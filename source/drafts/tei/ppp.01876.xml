                  hawsers and ties, a spreading of sails to the wind&#8212;a starting out on unknown
                  seas, to fetch up no one knows whither&#8212;to return no more&#8212;And the

                  its cluster, to finish and explain much that, without them, would not be
                  explain'd, and to take leave, and escape for good, from all that has preceded
                  them. (Then probably <hi rend="italic">Passage to India</hi>, and its cluster, are but freer vent and

                  the whole and several, that other pervading invisible fact, so large a part, (is
                  it not the largest part?) of life here, combining the rest, and furnishing, for
                  Person or State, the only permanent and unitary meaning to all, even the meanest
                  life, consistently with the dignity of the Universe, in Time......As, from the
                  eligibility to this thought, and the cheerful conquest of this fact, flash forth
                  the first distinctive proofs of the Soul, so to me, (extending it only a little
                  further,) the ultimate Democratic purports, the ethereal and spiritual ones, are
                  to concentrate here, and as fixed stars, radiate hence. For, in my opinion, it is
                  no less than this idea of Immortality, above all other ideas, that is to enter
                  into, and vivify, and give crowning religious stamp, to Democracy in the New
                  World.</p>
                <p>It was originally my intention, after chanting in L<hi rend="smallcaps">EAVES</hi> of G<hi rend="smallcaps">RASS</hi> the songs of
                  the Body and Existence, to then compose a further, equally needed Volume, based on
                  those convictions of perpetuity and conservation which, enveloping all precedents,
                  make the unseen Soul govern absolutely at last. I meant, while in a sort
                  continuing the theme of my first chants, to shift the slides, and exhibit the
                  problem and paradox of the same ardent and fully appointed Personlity entering the
                  sphere of the resistless gravitation of Spiritual Law, and with cheerful face
                  estimating Death, not at all as the cessation, but as somehow what I feel it must
                  be, the entrance upon by far the greatest part of existence, and something that
                  Life is at least as much for, as it is for itself.</p>
                <p>But the full construction of such a work (even if I lay the foundation, or give
                  impetus to it) is beyond my powers, and must remain for some bard in the future.
                  The physical and the sensuous, in themselves or in their immediate continuations,
                  retain holds upon me which I think are never entirely releas'd; and those holds I
                  have not only not denied, but hardly wish'd to weaken.</p>

                  entirely fulfil it, I end my books with thoughts, or radiations from thoughts, on
                  Death, Immortality, and a free entrance into the Spiritual world. In those
                  thoughts, in a sort, I make the first steps or studies toward the mighty theme,

                  atmosphere amid which I now revise this Volume, from the jocund influences

                  since of my dear Mother, the most perfect and magnetic character, the rarest
                  combination of practical, moral and spriritual, and the least selfish, of all and
                  any I have ever known&#8212;and by me O so much the most deeply loved.......and
                  also under the physical affliction of a tedious attack of paralysis, obstinately

                  of Egypt, the noisome skeleton of Death was also sent on exhibition to the

                <p>Since I have been ill, (1873-74-75,) mostly without serious pain, and with plenty
                  of time and frequent inclination to judge my poems, (never composed with eye on
                  the book-market, nor for fame, nor for any pecuniary profit,) I have felt
                  temporary depression more than once, for fear that in L<hi rend="smallcaps">EAVES
                    OF</hi> G<hi rend="smallcaps">RASS</hi> the <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> parts were not sufficiently
                  pronounc'd. But in my clearest and calmest moods I have realized that as those
                  L<hi rend="smallcaps">EAVES</hi>, all and several, surely prepare the way for, and necessitate Morals, and
                  are adjusted to them, just the same as Nature does and is, they are what,
                  consistently with my plan, they must and probably should be.......(In a certain
                  sense, while the Moral is the purport and last intelligence of all Nature, there
                  is absolutely nothing of the moral in the works, or laws, or shows of Nature.
                  Those only lead inevitably to it&#8212;begin and necessitate it.)</p>
                <p>Then I meant L<hi rend="smallcaps">EAVES OF</hi> G<hi rend="smallcaps">RASS</hi>,
                  as published, to be the Poem of Identity, (of <hi rend="italic">Yours</hi>,
                  whoever you are, now reading these lines)......For genius must realize
                  that, precious as it may be, there is something for more precious, namely, simple
                  Identity, One's-self. A man is not greatest as victor in war, nor inventor or
                  explorer, nor even in science, or in his intellectual or artistic capacity, or
                  exemplar in some vast benevolence. To the highest Democratic view, man is most
                  acceptable in living well the average, practical life and lot which happens to him
                  as ordinary farmer, sea-farer, mechanic, clerk, laborer, or driver&#8212;upon and
                  from which position as a central basis or pedestal, while performing its labors,
                  and his duties as citizen, son, husband, father and employed person, he preserves
                  his physique, ascends, developing, radiating himself in other regions&#8212;and
                  especially where and when, (greatest of all, and nobler than the proudest mere
                  genius or magnate in any field,) he fully realizes the Conscience, the Spiritual,
                  the divine faculty, cultivated well, exemplified in all his deeds and words,
                  through life, uncompromising to the end&#8212;a flight loftier than any of
                  Homer's or Shakspere's&#8212;broader than all poems and bibles&#8212;namely,
                  Nature's own, and in the midst of it, Yourself, your own Idenity, body and soul.
                  (All serves, helps&#8212;but in the centre of all, absorbing all, giving, for your
                  purpose, the only meaning and vitality to all, master or mistress of all, under
                  the law, stands Yourself.).....To sing the Song of that divine law of Identity,
                  and of Yourself, consistently with the Divine Law of the Universal, is a main
                  intention of those L<hi rend="smallcaps">EAVES</hi>.</p></note>

                  undisguisedly, declaredly, the openest expression.......Poetic literature has long
                  been the formal and conventional tender of art and beauty merely, and of a narrow,
                  constipated, special amativeness. I say, the subtlest, sweetest, surest tie

                <p>Besides, important as they are in my purpose as emotional expressions for
                  humanity, the special meaning of the <hi rend="italic">Calamus</hi> cluster of
                    L<hi rend="smallcaps">EAVES OF</hi> G<hi rend="smallcaps">RASS</hi>, (and more

                    >Drum-Taps</hi>,) mainly resides in its Political significance. In my opinion it
                  is by a fervent, accepted development of Comradeship, the beautiful and sane
                  affection of man for man, latent in all the young fellows, North and South, East
                  and West&#8212;it is by this, I say, and by what goes directly and indirectly
                  along with it, that the United States of the future, (I cannot too often repeat,)

                  Physique&#8212;an utterance adjusted to, perhaps born of, Democracy and Modern
                  Science, and in its very nature regardless of the old conventions, and, under the

                substantially the same, there are some vital things in which this Republic, as to its
                Individualities, and as a compacted Nation, is to specially stand forth, and
                culminate modern humanity. And these are the very things it least morally and
                mentally knows&#8212;(though, curiously enough, it is at the same time faithfully
                acting upon them.)</p>
              <p>I count with such absolute certainty on the Great Future of The United
                Sates&#8212;different from, though founded on, the past&#8212;that I have always invoked
                that Future, and surrounded myself with it, before or while singing my Songs....(As
                ever, all tends to followings&#8212;America, too, is a prophecy. What, even of the
                best and most successful, would be justified by itself alone? by the present, or the
                material ostent alone? Of men or States, few realize how much they live in the
                future. That, rising like pinnacles, gives its main significance to all You and I
                are doing to-day. Without it, there were little meaning in lands or poems&#8212;little purport in human lives.......All ages, all Nations and States, have been such
                prophecies. But where any former ones with prophecy so broad, so clear, as our times,
                our lands&#8212;as those of the West?)</p>

                thoroughly adopted the conclusions of the great Savans and Experimentalists of our
                time, and of the last hundred years, and they have interiorly tinged the chyle of
                all my verse, for purposes beyond. Following the Modern Spirit, the real Poems of
                the Present, ever solidifying and expanding into the Future, must vocalize the
                vastness and splendor and reality with which Scientism has invested Man and the
                Universe (all that is called Creation,) and must henceforth launch Humanity into new
                orbits, consonant with that vastness, splendor, and reality, (unknown to the old
                poems,) like new systems of orbs, balanced</p>

                limitless space, more subtle than the stars. Poetry, so largely hitherto and even at
                present wedded to children's tales, and to mere amorousness, upholstery and
                superficial rhyme, will have to accept, and, while not denying the Past, nor the
                Themes of the past, will be revivified by, this tremendous innovation, the Kosmic
                Spirit, which must henceforth, in my opinion, be the background and underlying
                impetus, more or less visible, of all first-class Songs.</p>

                fables, crudities and superstitions, and launch forth in renewed Faith and Scope a
                hundred fold. To me, the worlds of Religiousness, of the conception of the Divine,
                and of the Ideal, though mainly latent, are just as absolute in Humanity and the
                Universe as the world of Chemistry, or any thing in the objective worlds. To me, <q

                splendid Theology, and for ampler and diviner Songs. No year, nor even century, will
                settle this. There is a phase of the Real, lurking behind the Real, which it is all
                for. There is also in the Intellect of man, in time, far in prospective recesses, a
                judgment, a last appellate court, which will settle it.</p>
              <p>In certain parts, in these flights, or attempting to depict or suggest them, I have
                not been afraid of the charge of obscurity, in either of my Two
                Volumes&#8212;because human thought, poetry or melody, must leave dim escapes and
                outlets&#8212;must possess a certain fluid, &#230;rial character, akin to space itself,
                obscure to those of little or no imagination, but indispensable to the highest
                purposes. Poetic style, when address'd to the Soul, is less definite form, outline,
                sculpture, and becomes vista, music, half-tints, and even less than half-tints.
                True, it may be architecture; but again it may be the forest wild-wood, or the best
                effects therof, at twilight, the waving oaks and cedars in the wind, and the

                shaping through European feudalism&#8212;and still need to be averaged by the scale
                of the Centuries, from their point of view entire, and presented thence, conformably
                to the freedom and vastness of modern science......And even out of a Hundred Years,
                and on their scale, how small were the best thoughts, poems, conclusions and
                products, except for a certain invariable resemblance and uniform standard in the
                final thoughts, theology, poems, &#38;c., of all nations, all civilizations, all

              <p>1. Of most foreign countries, small or large, from the remotest times known, down

                one great undying Song, to help vitalize and increase the valor, wisdom, and
                elegance of Humanity, from the points of view attain'd by it up to date. The
                stupendous epics of India, the holy Bible itself, the Homeric canticles, the
                Nibelungen, the Cid Campeador, the Inferno, Shakspere's dramas of the passions and
                of the feudal lords, Burns's songs. Goethe's in Germany, Tennyson's poems in
                England, Victor Hugo's in France, and many more, are the widely various yet integral
                signs or land-marks, (in certain respects the highest set up by the human mind and
                soul, beyond science, invention, political amelioration, &#38;c.,) narrating in
                subtlest, best ways, the long, long routes of History, and giving identity to the
                stages arrived at by aggregate Humanity, and the conclusions assumed in its
                progressive and varied civilizations.....Where is America's art-rendering, in any
                thing like the spirit worthy of herself and the modern, to these characteristic
                immortal monuments?</p>

              <p>2. So far, in America, our Democratic Society, (estimating its various strata, in
                the mass, as one,) possesses nothing&#8212;nor have we contributed any
                characteristic music, the finest tie of Nationality&#8212;to make up for that
                glowing, blood-throbbing, religious, social, emotional, artistic, indefinable,
                indescribably beautiful charm and hold which fused the seperate parts of the old
                Feudal societies together in their wonderful interpenetration, in Europe and Asia,
                of love, belief and loyalty, running one way like a living weft&#8212;and
                picturesque responsibility, duty and blessedness, running like a warp the other way.
                (In the Southern States, under Slavery, much of the same.)....In coincidence, and as
                things now exist in The States, what is more terrible, more alarming, than the total
                want of any such fusion and mutuality of love, belief and rapport of interest,
                between the comparatively few successful rich, and the great masses of the
                unsuccessful, the poor?......As a mixed political and social question, is not this
                full of dark significance? Is it not worth considering as a problem and puzzle in
                our Democracy&#8212;an indispensable want to be supplied?</p>

                beyond&#8212;namely, the sane, eternal moral and spiritual-esthetic attributes,

                flourish, (nay, cannot exist,) without those elements. They will gradually enter
                into the chyle of sociology and literature. They will finally make the blood and the

                  waves beating the solitary sands, and the hulls of the ships in the distance. See, the figure of the great Admiral, walking the beach, as a stage, in this sublimest
                  tragedy&#8212;for what tragedy, what poem, so piteous and majestic as the real

                both sovereignties, contradictory as they are, are necessary. As the centripetal law
                were fatal alone, or the centrifugal law deadly and destructive alone, but together

                life-continuation of The States; one, the sacred principle of the Union, the right of
                ensemble, at whatever sacrifice&#8212;and yet Another, an equally sacred principle,
                the right of Each State, consider'd as a separate sovereign individual, in its own
                sphere. Some go zealously for one set of these rights, and some as zealously for the
                other set. We must have both; or rather, bred out of them, as out of mother and
                father, a Third set, the perennial result and combination of both, and neither
                jeopardized. I say the loss or abdication of one set, in the future, will be ruin to
                Democracy just as much as the loss of the other set. The problem is, to harmoniously
                adjust the two, and the play of the two.......[Observe the lesson of the divinity
                in Nature, ever checking the excess of one law, by an opposite, or seemingly
                opposite law&#8212;generally the other side of the same law.]......For the theory
                of this Republic is, not that the General government is the fountain of all life and
                power, dispensing it forth, around, and to the remotest portions of our territory,
                but that T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> P<hi rend="smallcaps">EOPLE</hi> are,
                represented in Both, underlying both the General and State governments, and
                consider'd just as well in their individualities and in their separate aggregates,
                or States, as consider'd in one vast Aggregate, as the Union. This was the original
                dual theory and foundation of the United States, as distinguish'd from the feudal
                and ecclesiastical single idea of monarchies and papacies, and the divine right of
                kings.......(Kings have been of use, hitherto, as representing the idea of the
                identity of nations. But, to American Democracy, <hi rend="italic">both</hi> ideas
                must be fulfill'd, and in my opinion the loss of vitality of either one will indeed

                <l>He will take the wildest steer in the world, and break him <lb/>and tame him;</l>

                  >ASSES</hi>.&#8212;In the talk (which I welcome) about the need of men of
                training, thoroughly school'd and experienced men, for Statesmen, I would present
                the following as an offset. It was written by me twenty years ago&#8212;and has been
                curiously verified since by the advent of Abraham Lincoln:</p>
              <p>I say no body of men are fit to make Presidents, Judges, and Generals, unless they
                themselves supply the best specimens of the same; and that supplying one or two such
                specimens illuminates the whole body for a thousand years. I expect to see the day
                when the like of the present <hi rend="italic">personnel</hi> of the Governments,
                Federal, State, municipal, military, and naval, will be look'd upon with derision,
                and when qualified Mechanics and young men will reach Congress and other official
                stations, sent in their working costumes, fresh from their benches and tools, and
                returning to them again with dignity. The young fellows must prepare to do credit to
                this destiny, for the stuff is in them. Nothing gives place, recollect, and never
                ought to give place, except to its clean superiors. There is more rude and
                undevelopt bravery, friendship, conscientiousness, clear-sightedness, and practical
                genius for any scope of action, even the broadest and highest, now among the
                American Mechanics and young men, than in all the official persons in These States,
                legislative, executive, judicial, military, and naval, and more than among all the
                literary persons. I would be much pleased to see some heroic, shrewd,
                fully-inform'd, healthy-bodied, middle-aged, beard-faced American Blacksmith or
                Boatman come doen from the West across the Alleghanies, and walk into the
                Presidency, dress'd in a clean suit of working attire, and with the tan all over his
                face, breast, and arms; I would certainly vote for that sort of man, possessing the
                due requirements, before any other candidate.</p>

                certain moods I have question'd whether far too much is not made of Manners. To an
                artist entirely great&#8212;and especially to that far-advanced stage of judgment
                beyond mortality which Kant is fond of suggesting as a standard and test&#8212;we
                can conceive that all of what is popularly call'd 'fine manners' would be of little
                or no account&#8212;and only positive qualities, power, interior meanings, sanities,
                morals, emotions, would be noticed.......The Exquisite Manners School, if not
                foreign to Democracy, is surely no help to it; but moral and manly Personalism is
                the help. Why not, like Nature, permit no glamour to affect us?......(But are not
                really fine manners the natural perfume, as it were, of all healthy, inward, even
                Democratic qualities?)</p>

              <p>I shall use the words America and Democracy as convertible terms. Not an ordinary

                history of Feudalism, or else prove the most tremendous failure of time. Not the
                least doubtful am I on any prospects of their material success. The triumphant
                future of their business, geographic, and productive departments, on larger scales
                and in more varieties than ever, is certain. In those respects the Republic must
                soon (if she does not already) outstrip all examples hitherto afforded, and dominate
                the world.<ref xml:id="r004" target="#n004">&#42;</ref></p>

              <p>Admitting all this, with the priceless value of our political institutions, general
                suffrage (and cheerfully acknowledging the latest, widest opening of the doors,) I
                say that, far deeper than these, what finally and only is to make of our Western
                World a Nationality superior to any hitherto known, and outtopping the past, must be
                vigorous, yet unsuspected Literatures, perfect personalities and sociologies,
                original, transcendental, and expressing (what, in highest sense, are not yet
                expressed at all,) Democracy and the Modern. With these, and out of these, I
                promulge new races of Teachers, and of perfect Women, indispensable to endow the
                birth-stock of a New World. For Feudalism, caste, the Ecclesiastic traditions,
                though palpably retreating from political institutions, still hold essentially, by
                their spirit, even in this country, entire possession of the more important fields,
                indeed the very subsoil, of education, and of social standards and Literature.</p>

                luxuriantly grows its own forms of arts, poems, schools, theology, displacing all

              <p> Viewed, to-day, from a point of view sufficiently overarching, the problem of
                humanity all over the civilized world is social and religious, and is to be finally
                met and treated by literature. The priest departs, the divine Literatus comes. Never
                was anything more wanted than, to-day, and here in The States, the Poet of the
                Modern is wanted, or the great Literatus of the Modern. At all times, perhaps, the
                central point in any nation, and that whence it is itself really swayed the most,
                and whence it sways others, is its national literature, especially its archetypal
                poems. Above all previous lands, a great original literature is surely to become the

                of men, that it still prevails powerfully to this day, in defiance of the mighty
                changes of time, was its literature, permeating to the very marrow, especially that

              <p>In short, as, though it may not be realized, it is strictly true, that a few
                first-class poets, philosophs, and authors, have substantially settled and given
                status to the entire religion, education, law, sociology, &#38;c., of the hitherto
                civilized world, by tinging and often creating the atmospheres out of which they
                have arisen, such also must stamp, and more than ever stamp, the interior and real
                Democratic construction of this American continent, to-day, and days to come.</p>

              <p>Remember also this fact of difference, that, while through the antique and through
                the medi&#230;val ages, highest thoughts and ideals realized themselves, and their
                expression made its way by other arts, as much as, or even more than by, technical
                literature, (not open to the mass of persons, nor even to the majority of eminent
                persons,) such literature in our day and for current purposes, is not only more
                eligible than all the other arts put together, but has become the only general means
                of morally influencing the world. Painting, sculpture, and the dramatic theatre, it
                would seem, no longer play an indispensable or even important part in the workings
                and mediumship of intellect, utility, or even high esthetics. Architecture remains,
                doubtless with capacities, and a real future. Then music, the combiner, nothing more
                spiritual, nothing more sensuous, a god, yet completely human, advances, prevails,
                holds highest place; supplying in certain wants and quarters what nothing else could
                supply. Yet, in the civilization of to-day it is undeniable that, over all the arts,
                literature dominates, serves beyond all&#8212;shapes the character of church and
                school&#8212;or, at any rate, is capable of doing so. Including the literature of

                Imaginative Literature, especially Poetry, the stock of all. In the department of
                Science, and the specialty of Journalism, there appear, in These States, promises,
                perhaps fulfilments, of highest earnestness, reality, and life. These, of course,
                are modern. But in the region of imaginative, spinal and essential attributes,
                something equivalent to creation is imperatively demanded. For not only is it not
                enough that the new blood, new frame of Democracy shall be vivified and held

                hold in men's hearts, emotions and belief, as, in their days, Feudalism or
                Ecclesiasticism, and inaugurates its own perennial sources, welling from the centre
                forever, its strength will be defective, its growth doubtful, and its main charm

                should some two or three really original American poets, (perhaps artists or
                lecturers,) arise, mounting the horizon like planets, stars of the first magnitude,
                that, from their eminence, fusing contributions, races, far localities, &#38;c.,
                together, they would give more compaction and more moral identity, (the quality
                to-day most needed,) to These States, than all its Constitutions, legislative and
                judicial ties, and all its hitherto political, warlike, or materialistic
                experiences. As, for instance, there could hardly happen anything that would more
                serve The States, with all their variety of origins, their diverse climes, cities,
                standards, &#38;c., than possessing an aggregate of heroes, characters, exploits,
                sufferings, prosperity or misfortune, glory or disgrace, common to all, typical of
                all&#8212;no less, but even greater would it be to possess the aggregation of a
                cluster of mighty poets, artists, teachers, fit for us, national expressers,
                comprehending and effusing for the men and women of The States, what is universal,
                native, common to all, inland and seaboard, northern and southern. The historians
                say of ancient Greece, with her ever-jealous autonomies, cities, and states, that
                the only positive unity she ever owned or received, was the sad unity of a common
                subjection, at</p>

                foreign conquerors. Subjection, aggregation of that sort, is impossible to America;
                but the fear of conflicting and irreconcilable interiors, and the lack of a common
                skeleton, knitting all close, continually haunts me. Or, if it does not, nothing is
                plainer than the need, a long period to come, of a fusion of The States into the
                only reliable identity, the moral and artistic one. For, I say, the true nationality
                of The States, the genuine union, when we come to a mortal crisis, is, and is to be,
                after all, neither the written law, nor, (as is generally supposed,) either

                comforts, is the main thing, and is enough. It may be argued that our Republic is,
                in performance, really enacting to-day the grandest arts, poems, &#38;c., by beating
                up the wilderness into fertile farms, and in her railroads, ships, machinery,
                &#38;c. And it may be asked, Are these not better, indeed, for America, than any
                utterances even of greatest rhapsode, artist, or literatus ?</p>

              <p>I too hail those achievements with pride and joy: then answer that the soul of man
                will not with such only&#8212;nay, not with such at all&#8212;be finally satisfied;
                but needs what, (standing on those and on all things, as the feet stand on the
                ground,) is addressed to the loftiest, to itself alone.</p>

              <p>Out of such considerations, such truths, arises for treatment in these Vistas the
                important question of Character, of an American stock-personality, with Literatures
                and Arts for outlets and return-expressions, and, of course, to correspond, within
                outlines common to all. To these, the main affair, the thinkers of the United

              <p>For my part, I would alarm and caution even the political and business reader, and
                to the utmost extent, against the prevailing delusion that the establishment of free
                political institutions, and plentiful intellectual smartness, with general good
                order, physical plenty, industry, &#38;c., (desirable and precious advantages as
                they all are,) do, of themselves, determine and yield to our experiment of Democracy
                the fruitage of success. With such advantages at present fully, or almost fully,
                possessed&#8212;the Union just issued, victorious, from the struggle with the only
                foes it need ever fear, (namely, those within itself, the interior ones,) and with
                unprecedented materialistic advancement&#8212;Society, in These States, is cankered,
                crude, superstitious, and rotten. Political, or law-made society is, and private, or
                voluntary society, is also. In any vigor, the element of the moral conscience, the
                most important, the vertebr&#230;, to State or man, seems to me either entirely lacking
                or seriously enfeebled or ungrown.</p>

                States. Genuine belief seems to have left us. The underlying principles of The
                States are not honestly believed in, (for all this hectic glow, and these
                melo-dramatic screamings,) nor is Humanity itself believed in. What penetrating eye
                does not everywhere see through the mask? The spectacle is appalling. We live in an
                atmosphere of hypocrisy throughout. The men believe not in the women, nor the women

                about his discoveries. The depravity of the business classes of our country is not
                less than has been supposed, but infinitely greater. The whole of the official
                services of America, National, State, and Municipal, in all their branches and
                departments, except the Judiciary, are steeped, saturated in corruption, bribery,
                falsehood, mal-administration; and the Judiciary is tainted. The great cities reek
                with respectable as much as non-respectable robbery and scoundrelism. In fashionable
                life, flippancy, tepid amours, weak infidelism, small aims, or no aims at all, only
                to kill time. In business, (this all-devouring modern word, business,) the one sole
                object is, by any means, pecuniary gain. The magician's serpent in the fable ate up
                all the other serpents; and money-making is our magician's serpent, remaining
                to-day sole master of the field. The best class we show, is but a mob of
                fashionably-dressed speculators and vulgarians. True, indeed, behind this fantastic
                farce, enacted on the visible stage of society, solid things and stupendous labors
                are to be discovered, existing crudely and going on in the background, to advance
                and tell themselves in time. Yet the truths are none the less terrible. I say that
                our New World Democracy, however great a success in uplifting the masses out of
                their sloughs, in materialistic development, products, and in a certain
                highly-deceptive superficial popular intellectuality, is, so far, an almost complete
                failure in its social aspects, in any superb general personal character, and in
                really grand religious, moral, literary, and esthetic results. In vain do we march
                with unprecedented strides to empire so colossal, outvying the antique, beyond
                Alexander's, beyond the proudest sway of Rome. In vain do we annex Texas,
                California, Alaska, and reach north for Canada and south for Cuba. It is as if we
                were somehow being endowed with a vast and more and more thoroughly-appointed body,

              <p>First, let us see what we can make out of a brief, general, sentimental
                consideration of political Democracy, and whence it has arisen, with regard to some
                of its current features, as an aggregate, and as the basic structure of our future
                literature and authorship. We shall, it is true, quickly and continually find the
                origin-idea of the singleness of man, individualism, asserting itself, and cropping
                forth, even from the opposite ideas. But the mass, or lump character, for imperative
                reasons, is to be ever carefully weighed, borne in mind, and provided for. Only from
                it, and from its proper regulation and potency, comes the other, comes the chance of
                Individualism. The two are contradictory, but our task is to reconcile them.<ref

                the like of the ancient virtue of Patriotism, the fervid and absorbing love of
                general country? I have no doubt myself that the two will merge, and will mutually
                profit and brace each other, and that from them a greater product, a third, will
                arise. But I feel that at present they and their oppositions form a serious problem

              <p>The political history of the past may be summed up as having grown out of what

                prompt deciding Authority, and of Cohesion, at all cost. Leaping time, we come to
                the period within the memory of people now living, when, as from some lair where
                they had slumbered long, accumulating wrath, sprang up and are yet active, (1790,
                and on even to the present, 1870,) those noisy eructations, destructive iconoclasms,
                a fierce sense of wrongs, and amid which moves the Form, well known in modern
                history, in the old world, stained with much blood, and marked by savage reactionary
                clamors and demands. These bear, mostly, as on one enclosing point of need.</p>

                and relations in society is thoroughly conned over and exhausted&#8212;it remains to
                bring forward and modify everything else with the idea of that Something a man is,
                (last precious consolation of the drudging poor,) standing apart from all else,
                divine in his own right, and a woman in hers, sole and untouchable by any canons of
                authority, or any rule derived from precedent, state-safety, the acts of

                been the political genesis and life of America. Advancing visibly, it still more
                advances invisibly. Underneath the fluctuations of the expressions of society, as
                well as the movements of the politics of the leading nations of the world, we see
                steadily pressing ahead, and strengthening itself, even in the midst of immense
                tendencies toward aggregation, this image of completeness in separatism, of
                individual personal dignity, of a single person, either male or female,
                characterized in the main, not from extrinsic acquirements or position, but in the
                pride of himself or herself alone; and, as an eventual conclusion and summing up,

                if, so far, there were some natural repugnance between a literary and professional

                barracks, (Washington City alone, with its suburbs, at one period, containing in her
                Army hospitals of this kind, 50,000 wounded and sick men)&#8212;and there ruled

                conscious of quick approaching death, yet perfectly calm, and with noble, spiritual
                manner, the veteran surgeon, turning aside, said to me, that though he had witnessed
                many, many deaths of soldiers, and had been a worker at Bull Run, Antietam,
                Fredericksburg, &#38;c., he had not seen yet the first case of man or boy that met
                the approach of dissolution with cowardly qualms or terror. My own observation fully
                bears out the remark.</p>

                plentifully-supplied, last-needed proof of Democracy, in its personalities ?
                Curiously enough, too, the proof on this point comes, I should say, every bit as
                much from the South, as from the North. Although I have spoken only of the latter,
                yet I deliberately include all. Grand, common stock ! to me the accomplished and
                convincing growth, prophetic of the future ; proof undeniable to sharpest sense, of
                perfect beauty, tenderness and pluck, that never Feudal lord, nor Greek, nor Roman
                breed, yet rivaled. Let no tongue ever speak in disparagement of the American races,

                government, (having, of course, provided for the police, the safety of life,
                property, and for the basic statute and common law, and their administration, always
                first in order,) to be, among the rest, not merely to rule, to repress disorder,
                &#38;c., but to develop, to open up to cultivation, to encourage the possibilities
                of all beneficent and manly outcroppage, and of that aspiration for independence,
                and the pride and self-respect latent in all characters. (Or, if there be
                exceptions, we cannot, fixing our eyes on them alone, make theirs the rule for
                all.)</p>

                the eminent writer, the rule of the best men, the born heroes and captains of the

                elective or dynastic!)&#8212;but, higher than the highest arbitrary rule, to train

                million, not for grand material personalities only, but for immortal souls. To be a
                voter with the rest is not so much ; and this, like every institute, will have its
                imperfections. But to become an enfranchised mart, and now, impediments removed, to
                stand and start without humiliation, and equal with the rest ; to commence, or have
                the road cleared to commence, the grand experiment of development, whose end,
                (perhaps requiting several generations,) may be the forming of a full-grown man or
                woman&#8212;that <hi rend="italic">is</hi> something. To ballast the State is also
                secured, and in our times is to be secured, in no other way.</p>

              <p>We do not, (at any rate I do not,) put it either on the ground that the People, the
                masses, even the best of them, are, in their latent or exhibited qualities,
                essentially sensible and good&#8212;nor on the ground of their rights ; but that,
                good or bad, rights or no rights, the Democratic formula is the only safe and
                preservative one for coming times. We endow the masses with the suffrage for their
                own sake, no doubt ; then, perhaps still more, from another point of view, for
                community's sake. Leaving the rest to the sentimentalists, we present Freedom as
                sufficient in its scientific aspects, cold as ice, reasoning, deductive, clear and
                passionless as crystal.</p>

                ; that of the superior law, in time, gradually supplanting and overwhelming the
                inferior one. (While, for myself, I would cheerfully agree&#8212;first covenanting
                that the formative tendencies shall be administered in favor, or, at least not
                against it, and that this reservation be closely construed&#8212;that until the

                endanger the State, the condition of authoritative tutel age may continue, and
                self-government must abide its time.)</p>

              <p>&#8212;Nor is the esthetic point, always an important one, without fascination for
                highest aiming souls. The common ambition strains for elevations, to become some
                privileged exclusive. The master sees greatness and health in being part of the
                mass. Nothing will do as well as common ground. Would you have in yourself the
                divine, vast, general law? Then merge yourself in it.</p>

              <p>And, topping Democracy, this most alluring record, that it alone can bind, and ever
                seeks to bind, all nations, all men, of however various and distant lands, into a
                brotherhood, a family. It is the old, yet evermodern dream of Earth," out of her
                eldest and her youngest, her fond philosophers and poets. Not that half only,
                Individualism, which isolates. There is another half, which is Adhesiveness or Love,
                that fuses, ties and aggregates, making the races comrades, and fraternizing all.
                Both are to be vitalized by Religion, (sole worthiest elevator of man or State,)
                breathing into the proud, material tissues, the breath of life. For I say at the
                core of Democracy, finally, is the Religious element. All the Religions, old and
                new, are there. Nor may the Scheme step forth, clothed in resplendent beauty and

              <p>I say of all dangers to a Nation, as things exist in our day, there can be no

                line drawn&#8212;they not privileged as others, but degraded, humiliated, made of no
                account. Much quackery teems, of coarse, even on Democracy's side, yet does not
                really affect the orbic quality of the matter. To work in, if we may so term it, and

                means nothing more, and does nothing more, than any other land. And as, by virtue of
                its kosmical, antiseptic power, Nature's stomach is fully strong enough not only to
                digest the morbific matter always presented, not to be turned aside, and perhaps,

                dare not say how many times the mood has come!) I, too, was filled with doubt and
                gloom. A foreigner, an acute and good man, had impressively said to me, that

                United States, and watched their politicians, and listened to the speeches of the
                candidates, and read the journals, and gone into the public houses, and heard the
                unguarded talk of men. And I have found your vaunted America honey-combed from top

                brazen hell-faces of secession and slavery gazing defiantly from all the windows and
                doorways. I have everywhere found, primarily, thieves and scalliwags arranging the
                nominations to offices, and sometimes filling the offices themselves. I have found
                the North just as full of bad stuff as the South. Of the holders of public office in
                the Nation, or in the States, or their municipalities, I have found that not one in
                a hundred has been chosen by any spontaneous selection of the outsiders, the people,
                but all have been nominated and put through by little or large caucuses of the
                politicians, and have got in by corrupt rings and electioneering, not capacity or
                desert. I have noticed how the millions of sturdy farmers and mechanics are thus the
                helpless supple-jacks of comparatively few politicians. And I have noticed more and
                more, the alarming spectacle of parlies usurping the Government, and openly and
                shamelessly wielding it for party purposes.</p>

              <p>Sad, serious, deep truths. Yet are there other, still deeper, amply confronting,
                dominating truths. Over those politicians and great and little rings, and over all
                their insolence and wiles, and over the powerfulest parties, looms a Power, too
                sluggish may-be, but ever holding decisions and decrees in hand, ready, with stern
                process, to execute them as soon as plainly needed, and at times, indeed, summarily
                crushing to atoms the mightiest parties, even in the hour of their pride.</p>

              <p>In saner hours far different are the amounts of these things from what, at first
                sight, they appear. Though it is no doubt important who is elected President or
                Governor, Mayor or Legislator, (and full of dismay when incompetent or vile ones get
                elected, as they sometimes do,) there are other, quieter contingencies, infinitely
                more important. Shams, &#38;c., will always be the show, like ocean's scum ; enough,
                if waters deep and clear make up the rest. Enough, that while the piled embroidered
                shoddy gaud and fraud spreads to the superficial eye, the hidden warp and weft are
                genuine, and will wear forever. Enough, in short, that the race, the land which
                could raise such as the late Rebellion, could also put it down.</p>

              <p>The average man of a land at last only is important. He, in These States, remains
                immortal owner and boss, deriving good uses, somehow, out of any sort of servant in
                office, even the basest ; because, (certain universal requisites, and their settled
                regularity and protection, being first secured,) a Nation like ours, in a sort of
                geological formation state, trying continually new experiments, choosing new
                delegations, is not served by the best men only, but sometimes more by those that
                provoke it&#8212;by the combats they arouse. Thus national rage, fury, discussion,
                &#38;c., better than content. Thus, also, the warning signals, invaluable for after
                times.</p>

              <p>What is more dramatic than the spectacle we have seen repeated, and doubtless long
                shall see&#8212;the popular judgment taking the successful candidates on trial in
                the offices&#8212;standing off, as it were, and observing them and their doings for
                a while, and always giving, finally, the fit, exactly due reward ?</p>

              <p>I think, after all, the sublimest part of political history, and its culmination,
                is currently issuing from the American people. I know nothing grander, better
                exercise, better digestion, more positive proof of the past, the triumphant result
                of faith in humankind, than a well-contested American national election.</p>

                foreign. The great poems, Shakespeare included, are poisonous to the idea of the
                pride and dignity of the common people, the life-blood of Democracy. The models of
                our literature, as we get it from other lands, ultramarine, have had their birth in
                courts, and basked and grown in castle sunshine ; all smells of princes' favors. Of
                workers of a certain sort, we have, indeed, plenty, contributing after their kind ;
                many elegant, many learned, all complacent. But, touched by the National test, or
                tried by the standards of Democratic personality, they wither to ashes. I say I have
                not seen a single writer, artist, lecturer, or what not, that has confronted the
                voiceless but ever erect and active, pervading, underlying will and typic Aspiration
                of the land, in a spirit kindred to itself. Do you call those genteel little
                creatures American poets ? Do you term that perpetual, pistareen, paste-pot work,
                American art, American drama, taste, verse ? I think I hear, echoed as from some
                mountain-top afar in the West, the scornful laugh of the Genius of These States.</p>

                been essentially helped, though often harmed, by them. It has besn and is carried on
                by all the moral forces, and by trade, finance, machinery, intercommunications, and,
                in fact, by all the developments of history, and can no more be stopped than the

                the resonance and the many angry tempests, out of which its syllables have come,
                from pen or tongue. It is a great word, whose history, I suppose, remains unwritten,
                because that history has yet to be enacted. It is, in some sort, younger brother of
                another great and often-used word, Nature, whose history also waits unwritten.</p>

                of humanity, now and always current over the planet, on the scale of the impulses of
                the elements. Then it is also good to reduce the whole matter to the consideration
                of a single self, a man, a woman, on permanent grounds. Even for the treatment of
                the universal, in politics, metaphysics, or anything, sooner or later we come down
                to one single, solitary Soul.</p>

                before this simple idea. Under the luminousness of real vision, it alone takes
                possession, takes value. Like the shadowy dwarf in the fable, once liberated and

                special nativity and intention that he is, the man's self, the main thing, is a
                failure, however wide his general cultivation. Thus, in our times, refinement and
                delicatesse are not only at tended to sufficiently, but threaten to eat us up, like
                a cancer. Already, the Democratic genius watches, ill-pleased, these tendencies.
                Provision for a little healthy rudeness, savage virtue, justification of what one
                has in one's self, whatever it is, is demanded. Negative qualities, even
                deficiencies, would be a relief. Singleness and normal simplicity, and separation,
                amid this more and more complex, more and more artificialized, state of
                society&#8212;how pensively we yearn for them ! how we would welcome their return

              <p>In some such direction, then&#8212;at any rate enough to preserve the
                balance&#8212;we feel called upon to throw what weight we can, not for absolute
                reasons, but current ones. To prune, gather, trim, conform, and ever cram and stuff,
                is the pressure of our days. While aware that much can be said even in behalf of all
                this, we perceive that we have not now to consider the question of what is demanded
                to serve a half-starved and barbarous nation, or set of nations, but what is most
                applicable, most pertinent, for numerous congeries of conventional, over-corpulent
                societies already becoming stifled and rotten with flatulent, infidelislic

                for former conditions and for European lands, are but exiles and exotics here. No
                current of her life, as shown on the surfaces of what is authoritatively called her
                Society, accepts or runs into moral, social, or esthetic Democracy ; but all the

                the purposes of These States, on a radical change of category, in the distribution
                of precedence. I should demand a programme of Culture, drawn out, not for a single
                class alone, or for the parlors or lecture-rooms, but with an eye to practical life,
                the West, the working-men, the facts of farms and jackplanes and engineers, and of
                the broad range of the women also of the middle and working strata, and with
                reference to the perfect equality of women, and of a grand and powerful motherhood.
                I should demand of this programme or theory a scope generous enough to include the
                widest human area. It must have for its spinal meaning the formation of a typical

                prepare the canvas well beforehand. Parentage must consider itself in advance. (Will
                the time hasten when fatherhood and motherhood shall become a science&#8212;and the

                indispensable ; the questions of food, drink, air, exercise, assimilation,
                digestion, can never be intermitted. Out of these we descry a well-begotten
                Selfhood&#8212;in youth, fresh, ardent, emotional, aspiring, full of adventure ; at
                maturity, brave, perceptive, under control, neither too talkative nor too reticent,

                cap'able also of flashing&#8212;and a general presence that holds its own in the
                company of the highest. For it is native Personality, and that alone, that endows a

                  <hi rend="italic">aplomb</hi> ; and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> Culture, or any

                can only be, and is, indeed, to be, (I hope,) its all penetrating Religiousness. The
                architecture of Individuality will ever prove various, with countless different
                combinations ; but here they rise as into common pinnacles, some higher, some less

              <p>Indeed, the ripeness of Religion is doubtless to be looked for in this field of
                Individuality, and is a result that no organization or church can ever achieve. As
                history is poorly retained by what the technists call history, and is not given out
                from their pages, except the learner has in himself the sense of the well-wrapt,
                never yet written, perhaps impossible to be written, history&#8212;so Religion,
                although casually arrested, and, after a fashion, preserved in the churches and
                creeds, does not depend at all upon them, but is a part of the identified</p>

                churches, and not before.</p>

              <p>Personalism fuses this, and favors it. I should say, indeed, that only in the
                perfect uncontamination and solitariness of Individuality may the spirituality of
                Religion positively come forth at all. Only here, and on such terms, the meditation,
                the devout ecstasy, the soaring flight. Only here, communion with the mysteries, the
                eternal problems, Whence ? whither ? Alone, and identity, and the mood&#8212;and the

                wondrous lines to the sense. Bibles may convey, and priests expound, but it is
                exclusively for the noiseless' operation of one's isolated Self, to enter the pure

              <p>I have seen another woman who, from taste and necessity conjoined, has gone into
                practical affairs, carries on a mechanical business, partly works at it herself,
                dashes out more and more into real hardy life, is not abashed by the coarseness of
                the contact, knows how to be firm and silent at the same time, holds her own with
                unvarying coolness and decorum, and will compare, any day, with superior carpenters,
                farmers, and even boatmen and drivers. For all that, she has not lost the charm of
                the womanly nature, but preserves and bears it fully, though through such rugged
                presentation.</p>

              <p>Then there is the wife of a mechanic, mother of two children, a woman of merely
                passable English education, but of fine wit, with all her sex's grace and
                intuitions, who exhibits, indeed, such a noble female Personality, that I am fain to
                record it here. Never abnegating her own proper independence, but always genially
                preserving it, and what belongs to it&#8212;cooking, washing, child-nursing,
                house-tending, she beams sunshine out of all these duties, and makes them
                illustrious. Physiologically sweet and sound, loving work, practical, she yet knows
                that there are intervals, however few, devoted to recreation, music, leisure,
                hospitality&#8212;and affords such intervals. Whatever she does, and wherever she
                is, that charm, that indescribable perfume of genuine womanhood, attends her, goes
                with her, exhales from her, which belongs of right to all the sex, and is, or ought

                was known by the name of the Peacemaker. She was well toward eighty years old, of
                happy and sunny temperament, had always lived on a farm, was very neighborly,
                sensible and discreet, an invariable and welcomed favorite, especially with young
                married women. She had numerous children and grandchildren. She was uneducated, but

                had come to be a tacitly agreed upon domestic regulator, judge, settler of
                difficulties, shepherdess, and reconciler in the land. She was a sight to draw near
                and look upon, with her large figure, her profuse snow-white hair, dark eyes, clear
                complexion, sweet breath, and peculiar personal magnetism.</p>

              <p>The foregoing portraits, I admit, are frightfully out of line from these imported
                models of womanly Personality&#8212;the stock feminine characters of the current
                novelists, or of the foreign court poems, (Ophelias, Enids, Princesses, or Ladies of
                one thing or another,) which fill the envying dreams of so many poor girls, and are
                accepted by our young men, too, as supreme ideals of feminine excellence to be
                sought after. But I present mine just for a change.</p>

              <p>Then there are mutterings, (we will not now stop to heed them here, but they must
                be heeded,) of something more revolutionary. The day is coming when the deep
                questions of woman's entrance amid the arenas of practical life, politics, trades,
                &#38;c., will not only be argued all around us, but may be put to decision, and real

                of the United States, pictorial and melodramatic, not without use as studies, but

                a sufficient scale, the perfect Personalities, without noise, meet ; say in some
                pleasant Western settlement or town, where a couple of hundred best men and women,
                of ordinary worldly status, have by luck been drawn together, with nothing extra of

                can conceive such a community organized in running order, powers judiciously
                delegated, farming, building, trade, courts, mails, schools, elections, all attended
                to ; and then the rest of life, the main thing, freely branching and blossoming in
                each individual, and bearing golden fruit. I can see there, in every young and old
                man, after his kind, and in every woman after hers, a true Personality, developed,
                exercised proportionately in body, mind, and spirit. I can imagine this case as one
                not necessarily rare or difficult, but in buoyant accordance with the municipal and
                general requirements of our times. And I can realize in it the culmination of
                something better than any stereotyped <hi rend="italic">eclat</hi> of history or
                poems. Perhaps, unsung, undramatized, unput in essays or biographies&#8212;perhaps
                even some such community already exists, in Ohio, Illinois, Missouri, or somewhere,
                practically fulfilling itself, and thus outvying, in cheapest vulgar life, all that
                has been hitherto shown in best ideal pictures.</p>

              <p>In short, and to sum up, America, betaking herself to formative action, (as it is
                about time for more solid achievement and less windy promise,) must, for her
                purposes, cease to recognize a theory of character grown of Feudal aristocracies, or
                formed by merely esthetic or literary standards, or from any ultramarine, full-dress
                formulas of culture, polish, caste, &#38;c., and must sternly promulgate her own new
                standard, yet old enough, and accepting the old, the perennial, elements, and
                combining them into groups, unities, appropriate to the modern, the democratic, the
                West, and to the practical occasions and needs of our own cities, and of the
                agricultural regions. Ever the most precious in the common. Ever the fresh breeze of
                field, or hill, or lake, is more than any palpitation of fans, though of ivory, and
                redolent with perfume ; and the air is more than the costliest perfumes.</p>

                we show it also including the all-varied, all-permitting, all-free theorem of
                Individuality, and erecting therefor a lofty and hitherto unoccupied framework or

              <p>What, however, do we more definitely mean by New World Literature ? Are we not
                doing well enough here already? Are not the United States this day busily using,
                working, more printer's type, more presses, than any other country ? uttering and
                absorbing more publications than any other? Do not our publishers fatten quicker and
                deeper ? (helping themselves, under shelter of a delusive and sneaking law, or
                rather absence of law, to most of their forage, poetical, pictorial, historical,
                romantic, even comic, without money and without price&#8212;and fiercely resisting
                even the timidest proposal to pay for it.)</p>

              <p>Many will come under this delusion&#8212;but my purpose is to dispel it. I say that
                a nation may hold and circulate rivers and oceans of very readable print, journals,

                possess and circulate&#8212;of unquestionable aid and value&#8212;hundreds of new
                volumes annually composed and brought out here, respectable enough, indeed
                unsurpassed in smartness and erudition&#8212;with further hundreds, or rather
                millions, (as by free forage, or theft, aforementioned,) also thrown into the
                market,&#8212;And yet, all the while, the said nation, land, strictly speaking, may
                possess no literature at all.</p>

              <p>Repeating our inquiry, What, then, do we mean by real literature? especially, the
                American literature of the future ? Hard questions to meet. The clues are
                inferential, and turn us to the past. At best, we can only offer suggestions,

                Hebrew prophet, with spirituality, as in flashes of lightning, conscience, like
                red-hot iron, plaintive songs and screams of vengeance for tyrannies and
                enslavement; Christ, with bent head, brooding love and peace, like a dove ; Greek,
                creating eternal shapes of physical and esthetic proportion ; Roman, lord of satire,
                the sword, and the codex ;&#8212;of the figures, some far-off and veiled, others

                those spreading, undulating masses of squid, through which the whale, swimming with

              <p>Not but that doubtless our current so-called literature, (like an endless supply of
                small coin,) performs a certain service, and may-be, too, the service needed for the
                time, (the preparation service, as children learn to spell.) Everybody reads, and
                truly nearly everybody writes, either books, or for the magazines or journals. The
                matter has magnitude, too, after a sort. There is something impressive about the
                huge editions of the dailies, and weeklies, the mountain-stacks of white paper piled
                in the press-vaults, and the proud, crashing, ten-cylinder presses, which I can
                stand and watch any time by the half hour. Then, (though The States in the field of
                Imagination present not a single first-class work, not a single great Literatus,)
                the main objects, to amuse, to titillate, to pass away time, to circulate the news
                and rumors of news, to rhyme and read rhyme, are yet attained, and on a scale of
                infinity. To-day, in books, in the rivalry of writers, especially novelists,
                success, (so-called,) is for him or her who strikes the mean flat average, the
                sensational appetite for stimulus, incident, &#38;c., and depicts, to the common
                calibre, sensual, exterior life. To such, or the luckiest of them, as we see, the
                audiences are limitless and profitable ; but they cease presently. While, this day
                or any day, to workmen, portraying interior or spiritual life, the audiences were

              <p>&#8212;The old men, I remember as a boy, were always talking of American
                Independence. What is independence ? Freedom from all laws or bonds except those of
                one's own being, controlled by the universal ones. To lands, to man, to woman, what
                is there at last to each, but the inherent soul, nativity, idiocrasy, free,
                highestpoised, soaring its own flight, following out itself ?</p>

              <p>&#8212;At present, These States, in their theology and social standards, &#38;c.,
                (of greater importance than their political institutions,) are entirely held
                possession of by foreign lands. We see the sons and daughters of the New World,
                ignorant of its genius, not yet inaugurating the native, the universal, and the
                near, still importing the distant, the partial, and the dead. We see London, Paris,
                Italy&#8212;not original, superb, as where they belong&#8212;but second-hand here
                where they do not belong. We see the shreds of Hebrews, Romans, Greeks ; but where,
                on her own soil, do we see, in any faithful, highest, proud expression, America
                herself? I sometimes question whether she has a corner in her own house.</p>

                shared in common. The combination fraternizes, ties the races&#8212;is, in many
                particulars, under laws applicable indifferently to all, irrespective of climate or
                date, and, from whatever source, appeals to emotions, pride, love, spirituality,
                common to humankind. Nevertheless, they touch a man closest, (perhaps only actually

                it&#8212;but to most it is there a secret. This something is rooted in the invisible
                roots, the profoundest meanings of that place, race, or nationality ; and to absorb
                and again effuse it, uttering words and products as from its midst, and carrying it

                author, poet, historian, lecturer, and perhaps even priest and pliilosoph. Here, and

                considered with reference to purposes of patriotism, health, a noble Personality,
                religion, and the democratic adjustments, all these swarms of poems, dramatic plays,
                resultant so far from American intellect, and the formulation of our best ideas, are
                useless and a mockery. They strengthen and nourish no one, express nothing

                confectionery at public dinners, or the arrangement of curtains and hangings in a

                august occasions of this land. America demands a Poetry that is bold, modern, and

                America, it must extricate itself from even the greatest models of the past, and,
                while courteous to them, must have entire faith in itself and products out of its
                own original spirit only. Like her, it must place in the van, and hold up at all
                hazards, the banner of the divine pride of man in himself, (the radical foundation
                of the new religion.) Long enough have the People been listening to poems in which
                common Humanity, deferential, bends low, humiliated, acknowledging superiors. But
                America listens to no such poems. Erect, inflated, and fully self-esteeming be the

                the breasts of the young farmers of tide Northwest, or Canada, or boatmen of the

                practicality of its people, not to rise and soar above others also in its original
                styles in literature and art, and its own supply of intellectual and esthetic
                masterpieces, archetypal, and consistent with itself. I know not a land except ours
                that has not, to some extent, however small, made its title clear. The Scotch have
                their born ballads, tunes subtly expressing their past and present, and expressing
                character. The Irish have theirs. England, Italy, France, Spain, theirs. What has
                America? With exhaustless mines of the richest ore of epic, lyric, tale, tune,

                richest masses of material ever afforded a nation, more variegated, and on a larger

                expression of the idea, of Conscience, kept at topmost mark, absolute in itself,
                well cultivated, uncontaminated by the manifold weeds, the cheats, changes, and
                vulgarities of the fashions of the world. Even in religious fervor there is a touch
                of animal heat. But moral conscientiousness, crystalline, without flaw, not Godlike
                only, entirely Human, awes and enchants nie forever. Great is emotional Love, even
                in the order of the rational universe. But, if we must make gradations, I am clear
                there is something greater. Power, love, veneration, products, genius, esthetics,
                tried by subtlest comparisons, analyses, and in serenest moods, somewhere fail,
                somehow become vain. Then noiseless, with flowing steps, the lord, the sun, the last
                Ideal comes. By the names Bight, Justice, Truth, we suggest, but do not describe it.
                To the world of men it remains a dream, an idea as they call it. Biit no dream is it
                to the wise&#8212;but the proudest, almost only solid lasting thing of all.</p>

                henceforth move with equal sway, science, absolute reason, and the general

                remorseless, like fire and flame. Conscience, too, isolated from all else, and from
                the emotional nature, may but attain the beauty and purity of glacial, snowy ice. We
                want, for These States, for the general character, a cheerful, religious fervor,

                esthetic compositions. I do not mean the smooth walks, trimm'd hedges, butterflies,
                poseys and nightingales of the English poets, but the whole Orb, with its geologic
                history, the Kosmos, carrying fire and snow, that rolls through the illimitable
                areas, light as a feather, though weighing billions of tons. Furthermore, as by what
                we now partially call Nature is intended, at most, only what is entertainable by the
                physical conscience, the lessons of the esthetic, the sense of matter, and of good
                animal health&#8212;on these it must be distinctly accumulated, incorporated, that

                which, (while singing well of persons and events, of the passions of man, and the
                shows of the material universe,) the religious tone, the consciousness of mystery,
                the recognition of the future, of the unknown, of Deity, over and under all, and of
                the divine purpose, are never absent, but indirectly five tone to all&#8212;exhibit
                literature's real heights and elevations, towering up like the great mountains of

                celebrate, the central Divine Idea of All, suffusing universe, of eternal trains of
                purpose, in the development, by however slow degrees, of the physical, moral, and
                spiritual Kosmos. I say he has studied, meditated to no profit, whatever may be his
                mere erudition, who has not absorbed this simple consciousness and faith. It is not

                perceived, except from a point of view which is evanescent, yet we know at least one
                permanency, that Time and Space, in the will of God, furnish successive chains,
                completions of material births and beginnings, solve all discrepancies, fears and
                doubts, and eventually fulfil happiness&#8212;and that the prophecy of these births,
                namely Spiritual results, throws the true arch over all teaching, all science. The
                local considerations of sin, disease, deformity, ignorance, death, &amp;c., and
                their measurement by superficial mind, and ordinary legislation and theology, are to

                last, profoundest measure and test of a first-class literary or esthetic
                achievement, and when understood and put in force must fain, I say, lead to works,
                books, nobler than any hitherto known. Lo! Nature, (the only complete, actual poem,)
                existing calmly in the divine scheme, containing all, content, careless of the
                criticisms of a day, or these endless and wordy chatterers. And lo! to the
                consciousness of the soul, the permanent Identity, the thought, the something,
                before which the magnitude even of Democracy, Art, Literature, &#38;c., dwindles,
                becomes partial, measurable&#8212;something that fully satisfies, (which those do
                not.) That something is the All, and the idea of All, with the accompanying idea of
                Eternity, and of itself, the Soul, buoyant, indestructible, sailing space forever,
                visiting every region, as a ship the sea. And' again lo! the pulsations in all

                diastole of life in things&#8212;where-from I feel and know that death is not the
                ending, as was thought, but rather the real beginning&#8212;and that nothing ever is

                only in itself, but beyond itself. I have eulogized Homer, the sacred bards of
                Jewry, Eschylus, Juvenal, Shakespeare, &#38;c., and acknowledged their inestimable

                those&#8212;poets not only possessed of the religious fire and abandon of Isaiah,
                luxuriant in the epic talent of Homer, or for characters as Shakespeare, but
                consistent with the Hegelian formulas, and consistent with modern science. America
                needs, and the world needs, a class of bards who will, now and ever, so link and
                tally the rational physical being of man, with the ensembles of Time and Space, and
                with this vast and multiform show, Nature, surrounding him, ever tantalizing him,
                equally a part, and yet not a part of him, as to essentially harmonize, satisfy, and
                put at rest. Faith, very old, now scared away by science, must be restored, brought
                back, by the same power that caused her departure&#8212;restored with new sway,
                deeper, wider, higher than ever. Surely, this universal ennui, this coward fear,
                this shuddering at death, these low, degrading views, are not always to rule the
                spirit pervading future society, as it has the past, and does the present. What the
                Roman Lucretius sought most nobly, yet all too blindly, negatively to do for his age
                and its successors, must be done positively by some great coming Literatus,
                especially Poet, who, while remaining fully poet, will absorb whatever science
                indicates, with spiritualism, and out of them, and out of his own genius, will
                compose the great Poem of Death. Then will man indeed confront Nature, and confront
                Time and Space, both with science and <hi rend="italic">con amore</hi>, and take his
                right place, prepared for life, master of fortune and misfortune. And then that
                which was long wanted will be supplied, and the ship that had it not before in all

                beauty, lawless as lightning, indefinite&#8212;yet power, wisdom, beauty, above all

                and after not a few departures, filling the vistas then, certain most coveted,

                Nature follows precedents. Vast oval halls will be constructed, on acoustic

                the people will make perfect music a part of their lives. Every phase, every trade
                will have its songs, beautifying those trades. Men on the land will have theirs, and
                men on the water theirs. Who now is ready to begin that work for America, of
                composing music fit for us&#8212;songs, choruses, symphonies, operas, oratorios,
                fully identified with the body and soul of The States ? music complete in all its
                appointments, but in some fresh, courageous, melodious, undeniable styles&#8212;as
                all that is ever to permanently satisfy us must be. The composers to make such music
                are to learn everything that can be possibly learned in the schools and traditions
                of their art, and then calmly dismiss all traditions from them.</p>

              <p>Also, a great breed of orators will one day spread over The United States, and be
                continued. Blessed are the people where, (the nation's Unity and Identity preserved
                at all hazards,) strong emergencies, throes, occur. Strong emergencies will
                continually occur in America, and will be provided for. Such orators are wanted as
                have never yet been heard upon the earth. What specimen have we had where even the
                physical capacities of the voice have been fully accomplished ? I think there would
                be in the human voice, thoroughly practised and brought out, more seductive pathos
                than in 'any organ or any orchestra of stringed instruments, and a ring more

                distant thing, that fetish it has been. It will become a friend, a venerable

              <p>&#8212;We see, fore-indicated, amid these prospects and hopes, new law-forces of
                spoken and written language&#8212;not merely the pedagogue-forms, correct, regular,
                familiar with precedents, made for matters of outside propriety, fine words,
                thoughts definitely told out&#8212;but a language fanned by the breath of Nature,
                which leaps overhead, cares mostly for impetus and effects, and for what it plants
                and invigorates to grow&#8212;tallies life and character, and seldomer tells a thing
                than suggests or necessitates it. In fact, a new theory of literary composition for
                imaginative works of the very first class, and especially for highest poems, is the
                sole course open to These States.</p>

              <p>Books are to be called for, and supplied, on the assumption that the process of
                reading is not a half-sleep, but, in highest sense, an exercise, a gymnast's
                struggle ; that the reader is to do something for himself, must be on the alert,
                must himself or herself construct indeed the poem, argument, history, metaphysical
                essay&#8212;the text furnishing the hints, the clue, the start or frame work. Not
                the book needs so much to be the complete thing, but the reader of the book does.
                That were to make a nation of supple and athletic minds, well-trained, intuitive,
                used to depend on themselves, and not on a few coteries of writers.</p>

                them, of the bloodless vein, the nerveless arm, the false application, at second or

                concentrate them, to turn upon them with wonder and love to command them, adorn
                them, and carry them upward into superior realms so out of the series of the
                preceding social and political universes, now arise These States their main purport
                being not in the newness and importance of their politics or inventions, but in new,

              <p>"S<hi rend="smallcaps">OCIETY."</hi>&#8212;I have myself little or no hope from
                what is technically called "Society" in our American cities. New York, of which
                place I have spoken so sharply, still promises something, in time, out of its
                tremendous and varied materials, with a certain superiority of intuitions, and the
                advantage of constant agitation, and ever new and rapid dealings of the cards. Of
                Boston, with its circles of social mummies, swathed in cerements harder than
                brass&#8212;its bloodless religion, (Unitarianism,) its complacent vanity of
                scientism and literature, lots of grammatical correctness, mere knowledge, (always
                wearisome, in itself )&#8212;its zealous abstractions, ghosts of reforms&#8212;I
                should say, (ever admitting its business powers, its sharp, almost demoniac,
                intellect, and no lack, in its own way, of courage and generosity)&#8212;there is,
                at present, little of cheering, satisfying sign. In the West, California, &#38;c.,
                "society" is yet unformed, puerile, seemingly unconscious of anything above a
                driving business, or to liberally spend the money made by it in the usual rounds and
                shows.</p>

              <p>Then there is, to the humorous observer of American attempts at fashion, according
                to the models of foreign courts and saloons, quite a comic side&#8212;particularly
                visible at Washington City,&#8212;a sort of high life below stairs business. As if
                any farce could be funnier, for instance, than the scenes of the crowds, winter
                nights, meandering around our Presidents and their wives, Cabinet officers, western
                or other Senators, Representatives, &#38;c.; born of good laboring, mechanic, or
                farmer stock and antecedents, attempting those full-dress receptions, finesse of
                parlors, foreign ceremonies, etiquettes, &#38;c.</p>

              <p>Indeed, considered with any sense of propriety, or any sense at all, the whole of
                this illy-played fashionable play and display, with their absorption of the best
                part of our wealthier citizens' time, money, energies, &#38;c., is ridiculously out
                of place in the United States. As if our proper man and woman, (far, far greater
                words than " gentleman " and " lady,") could still fail to see, and presently
                achieve, not this spectral business, but something truly noble, active, sane,
                American&#8212;by modes, perfections of character, manners, costumes, social
                relations, &#38;c., adjusted to standards, far, far different from those !</p>


              <pb facs="ppp.01876.0124.jpg" xml:id="leaf062v" n="80" type="verso"/>

              <p>&#8212;Eminent and liberal foreigners, British or continental, must at times have
                their faith fearfully tried by what they see of our New World personalities. The
                shallowest and least American persons seem surest to push abroad and call without
                fail on wellknown foreigners, who are doubtless affected with indescribable qualms
                by these queer ones. Then, more than half of our authors and writers evidently think
                it a great thing to be " aristocratic,"and sneer at progress, democracy, revolution,
                &#38;c. If some international literary Snobs' Gallery were established, it is
                certain that America could contribute at least her full share of the portraits, and
                some very distinguished ones. Observe that the most impudent slanders, low insults,
                &#38;c., on the great revolutionary authors, leaders, poets, &#38;c., of Europe,
                have their origin and main circiilation in certain circles here. The treatment of
                Victor Hugo living, and Byron dead, are samples. Both deserving so well of America ;
                and both persistently attempted to be soiled here by unclean birds, male and
                female.</p>

              <p>&#8212;Meanwhile, I must still offset the like of the foregoing, and all it infers,
                by the recognition of the fact, that while the surfaces of current society here show
                so much that is dismal, noisome and vapory, there are, beyond question,
                inexhaustible supplies, as of true gold ore, in the mines of America's general
                humanity. Let us, not ignoring the dross, give fit stress to these precious,
                immortal values also. Let it be distinctly admitted, that&#8212;whatever may be said
                of our fashionable society, and of any foul fractions and episodes&#8212;only here
                in America, out of the long history, and manifold presentations of the ages, has at
                last arisen, and now stands, what never before took positive form and sway, THE
                PEOPLE&#8212;and that, viewed en-masse, and while fully acknowledging deficiencies,
                dangers, faults, this People, inchoate, latent, not yet come to majority, nor to its
                own religious, literary or esthetic expression, yet affords, to-day, an exultant
                justification of all the faith, all the hopes and prayers and prophecies of good men
                through the past&#8212;the stablest, solidest-based government of the
                world&#8212;the most assured in a future&#8212;the beaming Pharos to whose perennial
                light all earnest eyes, the world over, are tending&#8212;And that already, in and
                from it, the Democratic principle, having been mortally tried by severest tests,
                fatalities, of war and peace, now issues from the trial, unharmed, trebly-in
                vigorated, perhaps to commence forthwith its finally triumphant march around the

                enterprise and soul of the great Spanish race&#8212;bearing ourselves always
                courteous, always deferential, indebted beyond measure to the mother-world, to all
                its nations dead, as all its nations living&#8212;the offspring, this America of
                ours, the Daughter, not by any means of the British isles exclusively, but of the
                Continent, and all continents. Indeed, it is time we should realize and fully
                fructify those germs we also hold from Italy, France, Spain, especially in the best
                imaginative productions of those lands, which are, in many ways, loftier and subtler
                than the English, or British, and indispensable to complete our service,
                proportions, education, reminiscences, &#38;c.....The British element These States
                hold, and have always held, enormously beyond its fit proportions. I have already
                spoken of Shakespeare. He seems to me of astral genius, first class, entirely fit
                for feudalism. His contributions, especially to the literature of the passions, are
                immense, forever dear to humanity&#8212;and his name is always to be reverenced in
                America. But there is much in him that is offensive to Democracy. He is not only the
                tally of Feudalism, but I should say Shakespeare is incarnated, uncompromising
                Feudalism, in literature. Then one seems to detect something in him&#8212;I hardly
                know how to describe it even amid the dazzle of his genius; and, in inferior
                manifestations, it is found in nearly all leading British authors. (Perhaps we will
                have to import the words Snob, Snobbish, &#38;c., after all.) While of the great
                poems of Asian antiquity, the Indian epics, the Book of Job, the Ionian Iliad, the
                unsurpassedly simple, loving, perfect idyls of the life and death of Christ, in the
                New Testament, (indeed Homer and the Biblical utterances intertwine familiarly with
                us, in the main,) and along down, of most of the characteristic imaginative or
                romantic relics of the continent, as the Cid, Cervantes' Don Quixote, &#38;c., I
                should say they substantially adjust themselves to us, and, far off as they are,
                accord curiously with our bed and board, today, in 1870, in Brooklyn, Washington,
                Canada, Ohio, Texas, California&#8212;and with our notions, both of seriousness and
                of fun, and our standards of heroism, manliness, and even the Democratic
                requirements those requirements&#8212;are not only not fulfilled in the Shakesperean
                productions, but are insulted on every page.</p>

              <p>I add that&#8212;while England is among the greatest of lands in political freedom,
                or the idea of it, and in stalwart personal character, &#38;c.&#8212;the spirit of
                English literature is not great, at least is not greatest&#8212;and its products are
                no models for us. With the exception of Shakespeare, there is no first-class genius,
                or approaching to first-class, in that literature&#8212;which, with a truly vast
                amount of value, and of artificial beauty, (largely from the classics,) is almost
                always material, sensual, not spiritual&#8212;almost always congests, makes
                plethoric, not frees, expands, dilates&#8212;is cold, anti-Democratic, loves to be
                sluggish and stately, and shows much of that characteristic of vulgar persons, the
                dread of saying or doing something not at all improper in itself, but
                unconventional, and that may be laughed at. In its best, the sombre <choice>

                British imaginative literature without the cheerful name of Walter Scott. In my
                opinion he deserves to stand next to Shakespeare. Both are, in their best and

                their lands and origin, namely feudality, yet ascending into universalism. Then, I
                should say, both deserve to be finally considered and construed as shining suns,
                whom it were ungracious to pick spots upon.)</p>

              <p>I strongly recommend all the young men and young women of the United States to whom
                it may be eligible, to overhaul the well-freighted fleets, the literatures of Italy,
                Spain, France, Germany, so full of those elements of freedom, self possession,
                gayheartedness, subtlety, dilation, needed in preparations for the future of The
                States. I only wish we could have really good translations. I rejoice at the feeling
                for Oriental researches and poetry, and hope it will go on.</p>

                history, society, &#38;c. Though it was not certain, hardly probable, that the
                effort for founding a Slave-Holding power, by breaking up the Union, should be
                successful, it was urged on by indomitable passion, pride and will. The signal
                downfall of this effort, the abolition of Slavery, and the extirpation of the
                Shareholding Class, (cut out and thrown away like a tumor by surgical operation,)
                makes incomparably the longest advance for Radical Democracy, utterly removing its
                only really dangerous impediment, and insuring its progress in the United
                States&#8212;and thence, of course, over the world.....(Our immediate years witness
                the solution of three vast, life-threatening calculi, in different parts of the

                elections go on, laws are passed, political parties struggle, issue their platforms,
                &#38;c., just the same as before. But immensest results of the War&#8212;not only in
                Politics, but in Literature, Poems, and Sociology&#8212;are doubtless waiting yet
                unformed, in the future. How long they will wait I cannot tell. The pageant of

                and again. An unsurpassed series of revolutionary events, influences. Yet it took
                over two hundred years for the seeds of the Crusades to germinate before beginning
                even to sprout. Two hundred years they lay, sleeping, not dead, but dormant in the
                ground. Then, out of them, unerringly, arts, travel, navigation, politics,
                literature, freedom, inventions, the spirit of adventure, inquiry, all arose, grew,
                and steadily sped on to what we see at present. Far back there, that huge
                agitation-struggle of the Crusades, stands, as undoubtedly the embryo, the start, of
                the high preeminence of experiment, civilization and enterprise which the European

            <p>THE impetus and ideas urging me, for some, years past, to an utterance, or attempt at
              utterance, of New World songs, and an epic of Democracy, having already had their
              published expression, as well as I can expect to give it, in L<hi rend="smallcaps"
                >EAVES</hi> O<hi rend="smallcaps">F</hi> G<hi rend="smallcaps">RASS,</hi> the
              present and any future pieces from me are really but the surplusage forming after that
              Volume, or the wake eddying behind it. I fulfilled in that an imperious conviction,
              and the commands of my nature as total and irresistible as those which make the sea
              flow, or the globe revolve. But of this Supplementary Volume, I confess I am not so
              certain. Having from early manhood abandoned the business pursuits and applications
              usual in my time and country, and obediently yielded myself up ever since to the
              impetus mentioned, and to the work of expressing those ideas, it may be that mere
              habit has got dominion of me, when there is no real need of saying any thing further.
              . . . But what is life but an experiment ? and mortality but an exercise ? with
              reference to results beyond. And so shall my poems be. If incomplete here, and
              superfluous there, <hi rend="italic">n'importe</hi>&#8212;the earnest trial and
              persistent exploration shall at least be mine, and other success failing, shall be
              success enough. I have been more anxious, anyhow, to suggest the songs of vital
              endeavor, and manly evolution, and furnish something for races of outdoor athletes,
              than to make perfect rhymes, or reign in the parlors. I ventured from the beginning,
              my own way, taking chances&#8212;and would keep on venturing.</p>

            <p>I will therefore not conceal from any persons, known or unknown to me, who take
              interest in the matter, that I have theambition of devoting yet a few years to poetic
              composition. . . .The mighty present age ! To absorb, and express in poetry,any thing
              of it&#8212;of its world&#8212;America&#8212;cities and States&#8212;the <pb
                facs="ppp.01876.0156.jpg" xml:id="leaf078v" n="vi" type="verso"/> years, the events
              of our Nineteenth Century&#8212;the rapidity of movement&#8212;the violent contrasts,
              fluctuations of light and shade, of hope and fear&#8212;the entire revolution made by
              science in the poetic method&#8212;these great new underlying facts and new ideas
              rushing and spreading everywhere ;&#8212;Truly a mighty age ! As if in some colossal
              drama, acted again like those of old, under the open sun, the Nations of our time, and
              all the characteristics of Civilization, seem hurrying, stalking across, flitting from
              wing to wing, gathering, closing up, toward some long-prepared, most tremendous
              denouement. Not to conclude the infinite scenas of the race's life and toil and
              happiness and sorrow, but haply that the boards be cleared from oldest, worst
              incumbrances, accumulations, and Man resume the eternal play anew, and under happier,
              freer auspices. ... To me, the United States are important because, in this colossal
              drama, they are unquestionably designated for the leading parts, for many a century to
              come. In them History and Humanity seem to seek to culminate. Our broad areas are even
              now the busy theatre of plots, passions, interests, and suspended problems, compared
              to which the intrigues of the past of Europe, the wars of dynasties, the scope of
              kings and kingdoms, and even the development of peoples, as hitherto, exhibit scales
              of measurement comparatively narrow and trivial. And on these areas of ours, as on a
              stage, sooner or later, something like an <hi rend="italic">eclaircissement</hi> of
              all the past civilization of Europe and Asia is probably to be evolved.</p>

            <p>The leading parts. . . . Not to be acted, emulated here, by us again, that role till
              now foremost in History&#8212;Not to become a conqueror Nation, or to achieve the
              glory of mere military, or diplomatic, or commercial superiority&#8212;but to become
              the grand Producing Land of nobler Men and Women&#8212;of copious races, cheerful,
              healthy, tolerant, free&#8212;To become the most friendly Nation, (the United States
              indeed,)&#8212;the modern composite Nation, formed from all, with room for all,
              welcoming all immigrants&#8212;accepting the work of our own interior development, as
              the work fitly filling ages and ages to come ;&#8212;the leading Nation of peace, but
              neither ignorant nor incapable of being the leading Nation of war ;&#8212;not the
              Man's Nation only, but the <pb facs="ppp.01876.0157.jpg" xml:id="leaf079r" n="vii"

              calculate&#8212;but, so far, no social, literary, religious, or esthetic
              organizations, consistent with our politics, or becoming to us&#8212;which
              organizations can only come, in time, through native schools or teachers of great
              Democratic Ideas, Religion&#8212;through Science, which now, like a new sunrise,
              ascending, begins to illuminate all&#8212;and through our own begotten Poets and
              Literatuses. . . . (The moral of a late well-written book on Civilization seems to be
              that the only real foundation walls and basis&#8212;and also <hi rend="italic">sine
                qua non</hi> afterward of true and full Civilization, is the eligibility and
              certainty of boundless products for feeding, clothing, sheltering every
              body&#8212;perennial fountains of physical and domestic comfort, with
              intercommunication, and with civil and ecclesiastical freedom ; and that then the
              esthetic and mental business will take care of itself. . . . Well, the United States
              have established this basis, and upon scales of extent, variety, vitality, and
              continuity, rivaling those of Nature ; and have now to proceed to build an Edifice

              a modern Image-Making creation is indispensable to fuse and express the modern
              Political and Scientific creations&#8212;and then the Trinity will be complete.)</p>

            <p>When I commenced, years ago, elaborating the plan of my poems, and continued turning
              over that plan, and shifting it in my mind through many years, (from the age of
              twenty-eight to thirty-five,) experimenting much, and writing and abandoning much, one
              deep purpose underlay the others, and has underlain it and its execution ever
              since&#8212;and that has been the Religious purpose. Amid many changes, and a
              formulation taking far different shape from what I at first supposed, this basic
              purpose has never been departed from in the composition of my verses. Not of course to
              exhibit itself in the old ways, as in writing hymns or psalms with an eye to the
              church-pew, or to express conventional pietism, or the sickly yearnings of devotees,
              but in new ways, and aiming at the widest sub-bases and inclusions of Humanity, and
              tallying the fresh air of sea and land. I will see, (said I to myself,) whether there
              is not, for my purposes as poet, a Religion, and a sound Religious germenancy in the
              average Human Race, at least in their modern development in the United States, and in
              the hardy common fibre and native yearnings and elements, deeper and larger, and
              affording more profitable returns, than all mere sects or churches&#8212;as boundless,
              joyous, and vital as Nature itself&#8212;A germenancy that has too long been
              unencouraged, unsung, almost unknown. . . . With Science, the Old Theology of the
              East, long in its dotage, begins evidently to die and disappear. But (to my mind)
              Science&#8212;and may be such will prove its principal service&#8212;as evidently
              prepares the way for One indescribably grander&#8212;Time's young but perfect
              offspring&#8212;the New Theology&#8212;heir of the West&#8212;lusty and loving, and
              wondrous beautiful. For America, and for to-day, just the same as any day, the supreme
              and final Science is the Science of God&#8212;what we call science being only its
              minister&#8212;as Democracy is or shall be also. And a poet of America (I said) must
              fill himself with such thoughts, and chant his best out of them......And as those were
              the convictions and aims, for good or bad, of <pb facs="ppp.01876.0159.jpg"
                xml:id="leaf080r" n="IX" type="recto"/> L<hi rend="smallcaps">EAVES</hi> O<hi
                rend="smallcaps">F</hi> G<hi rend="smallcaps">RASS,</hi> they are no less the
              intention of this Volume. As there can be, in my opinion, no sane and complete
              Personality&#8212;nor any grand and electric Nationality, without the stock element of
              Religion imbuing all the other elements, (like heat in chemistry, invisible itself,
              but the life of all visible life,) so there can be no Poetry worthy the name without
              that element behind all......The time has certainly come to begin to discharge the
              idea of Religion, in the United States, from mere ecclesiasticism, and from Sundays
              and churches and church-going, and assign it to that general position, chiefest, most
              indispensable, most exhilarating, to which the others are to be adjusted, inside of
              all human character, and education, and affairs. The people, especially the young men
              and women of America, must begin to learn that Religion, (like Poetry,) is something
              far, far different from what they supposed. It is, indeed, too important to the power
              and perpetuity of the New World to be consigned any longer to the churches, old or
              new, Catholic or Protestant&#8212;Saint this, or Saint that....It must be consigned
              henceforth to Democracy <hi rend="italic">en masse</hi>, and to Literature. It must
              enter into the Poems of the Nation. It must make the Nation.</p>

            <p>The Four Years' War is over&#8212;and in the peaceful, strong, exciting, fresh
              occasions of To-day, and of the Future, that strange, sad war is hurrying even now to
              be forgotten. The camp, the drill, the lines of sentries, the prisons, the
              hospitals,&#8212;(ah ! the hospitals !)&#8212;all have passed away all seem now like a
              dream. A new race, a young and living generation, already sweeps in with oceanic
              currents, obliterating that war, and all its scars, its mounded graves, and all its
              reminiscences of hatred, conflict, death. So let it be obliterated. I say the life of
              the present and the future makes undeniable demands upon us each and all, South,
              North, East, West. ... To help put the United States (even if only in imagination)
              hand in hand, in one unbroken circle in a chant&#8212;To rouse them to the
              unprecedented grandeur of the part they are to play, and are even now playing&#8212;to
              the thought of their great Future, and the attitude conformed to it&#8212;especially
              their great Esthetic, Moral, Scientific. Future, (of which their vulgar material and
                <pb facs="ppp.01876.0160.jpg" xml:id="leaf080v" n="X" type="verso"/> political
              present is but as the preparatory tuning of instruments by an orchestra,)&#8212;these,
              as hitherto, are still, for me, amongmy hopes, ambitions.</p>

              amplifying the same purpose, I suppose I have in my mind to run through the chants of

              of it, pencilled in the open air, on my fifty-third birth-day, by wafting to you, dear
              Reader, whoever you are, (from amid the fresh scent of the grass, the pleasant
              coolness of the forenoon breeze, the lights and shades of tree-boughs silently
              dappling and playing around me, and the notes of the cat-bird for undertone and

            <p>D<hi rend="smallcaps">URING</hi>the Union War I commenced at the close of 1862, and
              continued steadily through '63, '64 and '65, to visit the sick and wounded of the
              Army, both on the field and in the Hospitals in and around Washington city. From the
              first I kept little note-books for impromptu jottings in pencil to refresh my memory
              of names and circumstances, and what was specially wanted, &#38;c. In these I brief'd
              cases, persons, sights, occurrences in camp, by the bedside, and not seldom by the
              corpses of the dead. Of the present Volume most of it's pages are <hi rend="italic"
                >verbatim</hi> renderings from such pencillings on the spot. Some were scratch'd
              down from narratives I heard and itemized while watching, or waiting, or tending
              somebody amid those scenes. I have perhaps forty such little note-books left, forming
              a special history of those years, for myself alone, full of associations never to be
              possibly said or sung. I wish I could convey to the reader the associations that
              attach to these soil'd and creas'd little livraisons, each composed of a sheet or two
              of paper, folded small to carry in the pocket, and fasten'd with a pin. I leave them
              just as I threw them by during the War, blotch'd here and there with more than one
              blood-stain, hurriedly written, sometimes at the clinique, not seldom amid the
              excitement of uncertainty, or defeat, or of action, or getting ready for it, or a
              march. Even these days, at the lapse of many years, I can never turn their tiny
              leaves, or even take one in my hand, without the actual army sights and hot emotions
              of the time rushing like a river in full tide through me. Each line, each scrawl, each
              memorandum, has its history. Some pang of anguish&#8212;some tragedy, profounder than
              ever poet wrote. Out of them arise active and breathing forms. They summon up, even in
              this silent and vacant room as I write, not only the sinewy regiments and brigades,
              marching or in camp, but the countless phantoms of those who fell and were hastily
              buried by wholesale in the battle-pits, or whose dust and bones have been since
              removed to the National Cemeteries of the land, especially through Virginia and
              Tennessee. (Not, Northern soldiers&#8212;only many indeed the Carolinian, Georgian,
              Alabamian, Louisianian, Virginian&#8212;many a Southern face and form, pale,
              emaciated, with that strange tie of confidence and love between us, welded by
              sickness, pain of wounds, and little daily, nightly offices of nursing and friendly
              words and visits, comes up amid the rest, and does <pb facs="ppp.01876.0186.jpg"
                xml:id="leaf093v" n="4" type="verso"/> not mar, but rounds and gives a finish to the
              meditation.) Vivid as life, they recall and identify the long Hospital Wards, with
              their myriad-varied scenes of day or night&#8212;the graphic incidents of field or
              camp&#8212;the night before the battle, with many solemn yet cool
              preparations&#8212;the changeful exaltations and depressions of those four years,
              North and South&#8212;the convulsive memories, (let but a word, a broken sentence,
              serve to recall them)&#8212;the clues already quite vanish'd, like some old dream, and
              yet the list significant enough to soldiers&#8212;the scrawl'd, worn slips of paper
              that came up by bushels from the Southern prisons, Salisbury or Andersonville, by the
              hands of exchanged prisoners&#8212;the clank of crutches on the pavements or floors of
              Washington, or up and down the stairs of the Paymasters' offices&#8212;the Grand
              Review of homebound veterans at the close of the War, cheerily marching day after day
              by the President's house, one brigade succeeding another until it seem'd as if they
              would never end&#8212;the strange squads of Southern deserters, (<hi rend="italic"
                >escapees</hi>, I call'd them ;) that little <hi rend="italic">genre</hi> group,
              unreck'd amid the mighty whirl, I remember passing in a hospital corner, of a dying
              Irish boy, a Catholic priest, and an improvised altar&#8212;Four years compressing
              centuries of native passion, first-class pictures, tempests of life and death&#8212;an
              inexhaustible mine for the Histories, Drama, Romance and even Philosophy of centuries
              to come&#8212;indeed the Verteber of Poetry and Art, (of personal character too,) for
              all future America, (far more grand, in my opinion, to the hands capable of it, than
              Homer's siege of Troy, or the French wars to Shakspere ;)&#8212;and looking over all,
              in my remembrance, the tall form of President Lincoln, with his face of deep-cut
              lines, with the large, kind, canny eyes, the complexion of dark brown, and the tinge
              of wierd melancholy saturating all.</p>

            <p>More and more, in my recollections of that period, and through its varied,
              multitudinous oceans and murky whirls, appear the central resolution and sternness of
              the bulk of the average American People, animated in Soul by a definite purpose,
              though sweeping and fluid as some great storm&#8212;the Common People, emblemised in
              thousands of specimens of first-class Heroism, steadily accumulating, (no regiment, no
              company, hardly a file of men, North or South, the last three years, without such
              first-class specimens.)</p>

            <p>I know not how it may have been, or may be, to others&#8212;to me the main interest
              of the War, I found, (and still, on recollection, find,) in those specimens, and in
              the ambulance, the Hospital, and even the dead on the field. To me, the points
              illustrating the latent Personal Character and eligibilities of These States, in the
              two or three millions of American young and middle-aged men, North and South, embodied
              in the armies&#8212;and especially the one-third or one-fourth of <pb
                facs="ppp.01876.0187.jpg" xml:id="leaf094r" n="5" type="recto"/> their number,
              stricken by wounds or disease at some time in the course of the contest&#8212;were of
              more significance even than the Political interests involved. (As so much of a Race
              depends on what it thinks of death, and how it stands personal anguish and sickness.
              As, in the glints of emotions under emergencies, and the indirect traits and asides in
              Plutarch, &#38;c., we get far profounder clues to the antique world than all its more
              formal history.)</p>

            <p>Future years will never know the seething hell and the black infernal background of
              countless minor scenes and interiors, (not the few great battles) of the Secession War
              ; and it is best they should not. In the mushy influences of current times the fervid
              atmosphere and typical events of those years are in danger of being totally forgotten.
              I have at night watch'd by the side of a sick man in the hospital, one who could not
              live many hours. I have seen his eyes flash and burn as he recurr'd to the cruelties
              on his surrender'd brother, and mutilations of the corpse afterward. [See, in the
              following pages, the incident at Upperville&#8212;the seventeen, kill'd as in the
              description, were left there on the ground. After they dropt dead, no one touch'd
              them&#8212;all were made sure of, however. The carcasses were left for the citizens to
              bury or not, as they chose.]</p>

            <p>Such was the War. It was not a quadrille in a ball-room. Its interior history will
              not only never be written. Its practicality, minutia of deeds and passions, will never
              be even suggested. The actual Soldier of 1862-'65, North and South, with all his ways,
              his incredible dauntlessness, habits, practices, tastes, language, his appetite,
              rankness, his superb strength and animality, lawless gait, and a hundred unnamed
              lights and shades of camp&#8212;I say, will never be written&#8212;perhaps must not
              and should not be.</p>

            <p>The present Memoranda may furnish a few stray glimpses into that life, and into those
              lurid interiors of the period, never to be fully convey'd to the future. For that
              purpose, and for what goes along with it, the Hospital part of the drama from '61 to
              '65, deserves indeed to be recorded&#8212;(I but suggest it.) Of that many-threaded
              drama, with its sudden and strange surprises, its confounding of prophecies, its
              moments of despair, the dread of foreign interference, the interminable campaigns, the
              bloody battles, the mighty and cumbrous and green armies, the drafts and
              bounties&#8212;the immense money expenditure, like a heavy pouring constant
              rain&#8212;with, over the whole land, the last three years of the struggle, an
              unending, universal mourning-wail of women, parents, orphans&#8212;the marrow of the
              tragedy concentrated in those Hospitals&#8212;(it seem'd sometimes as if the whole
              interest of the land, North and South, was one vast central Hospital, and all the rest
              of the affair but flanges)&#8212;those forming the Untold and Unwritten History of the

                >opposite Fredericksburgh, December</hi> 21, 1862.&#8212;Began my visits among the
              Camp Hospitals in the Army of the Potomac. Spent a good part of the day in a large
              brick mansion, on the banks of the Rappahannock, used as a Hospital since the
              battle&#8212;Seems to have receiv'd only the worst cases. Out doors, at the foot of a
              tree, within ten yards of the front of the house, I notice a heap of amputated feet,
              legs, arms, hands, &#38;c., a full load for a one-horse cart. Several dead bodies lie
              near, each cover'd with its brown woollen blanket. In the door-yard, towards the
              river, are fresh graves, mostly of officers, their names on pieces of barrel-staves or
              broken board, stuck in the dirt. (Most of these bodies were subsequently taken up and
              transported North to their friends.)..........The large mansion is quite crowded,
              upstairs and down, everything impromptu, no system, all bad enough, but I have no
              doubt the best that can be done ; all the wounds pretty bad, some frightful, the men
              in their old clothes, unclean and bloody. Some of the wounded are rebel soldiers and
              officers, prisoners. One, a Mississippian&#8212;a captain&#8212;hit badly in leg, I
              talk'd with some time ; he ask'd me for papers, which I gave him. (I saw him three
              months afterward in Washington, with his leg amputated, doing well.)..........I went
              through the rooms, downstairs and up. Some of the men were dying. I had nothing to
              give at that visit, but wrote a few letters to folks home, mothers, &#38;c. Also
              talk'd to three or tour, who seem'd most susceptible to it, and needing it.</p>

            <p>(Everything is quiet now, here about Falmouth and the Rappahannock, but there was
              noise enough a week or so ago. Probably the earth never shook by artificial means, nor
              the air reverberated, more than on that winter daybreak of eight or nine days since,
              when Gen. Burnside order'd all the batteries of the army to combine for the
              bombardment of Fredericksburgh. It was in its way the most magnificent and terrible
              spectacle, with all the adjunct of sound, throughout the War, The perfect hush of the
              just-ending night was suddenly broken by the first gun, and in an instant all the
              thunderers, big and little, were in full chorus, which they kept up without
              intermission for several hours.)</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">December</hi> 23 <hi rend="italic">to</hi> 31. The results of the
              late battles are exhibited everywhere about here in thousands of cases, (hundreds die
              every day,) in the Camp, Brigade, and Division Hospitals. These are merely tents, and
              sometimes very poor ones, the wounded lying on the ground, lucky if their blankets are
              spread on layers of pine or hemlock twigs or <pb facs="ppp.01876.0189.jpg"
                xml:id="leaf095r" n="7" type="recto"/> small leaves. No cots ; seldom even a
              mattress. It is pretty cold. The ground is frozen hard, and there is occasional snow.
              I go around from one case to another. I do not see that I do much good, but I cannot
              leave them. Once in a while some youngster holds on to me convulsively, and I do what
              I can for him ; at any rate, stop with him and sit near him for hours, if he wishes
              it.</p>

            <p>Besides the hospitals, I also go occasionally on long tours through the camps,
              talking with the men, &#38;c. Sometimes at night among the groups around the fires, in
              their shebang enclosures of bushes. These are curious shows, full of characters and
              groups. I soon get acquainted anywhere in camp, with officers or men, and am always
              well used. Sometimes I go down on picket with the regiments I know best.......As to
              rations, the army here at present seems to be tolerably well supplied, and the men
              have enough, such as it is, mainly salt pork and hard tack. Most of the regiments
              lodge in the flimsy little shelter-tents. A few have built themselves huts of logs and
              mud, with fireplaces.</p>

            <p>W<hi rend="smallcaps">ASHINGTON</hi>, <hi rend="italic">January</hi>, '63.&#8212;Left
              camp at Falmouth, with some wounded, a few days since, and came here by Aquia Creek
              railroad, and so on Government steamer up the Potomac. Many wounded were with us on
              the cars and boat. The cars were just common platform ones. The railroad journey of
              ten or twelve miles was made mostly before sunrise. The soldiers guarding the road
              came out from their tents or shebangs of bushes with rumpled hair and halfawake look.
              Those on duty were walking their posts, some on banks over us, others down far below
              the level of the track. I saw large cavalry camps off the road. At Aquia Creek landing
              were numbers of wounded going North. While I waited some three hours, I went around
              among them. Several wanted word sent home to parents, brothers, wives, &#38;c., Which
              I did for them, (by mail the next day from Washington.) On the boat I had my hands
              full. One poor fellow died going up.</p>

            <p>I am now remaining in and around Washington, daily visiting the hospitals. Am much in
              Patent Office, Eighth street, H street, Armory Square and others. Am now able to do a
              little good, having money, (as almoner of others home,) and getting
              experience........To-day, Sunday after noon and till nine in the evening, visited
              Campbell Hospital ; attended specially to one case in Ward 1 ; very sick with pleurisy
              and typhoid fever; young man, farmer's son, D. F. Russell, Company E, Sixtieth New
              York ; downhearted And feeble ; a long time before he would take any interest ; wrote
              a letter home to his mother, in Malone, Franklin County, N. T., at his request ; gave
              him some fruit and one or two other gifts: envelop'd and directed his letter, &#38;c,
              Then went thoroughly through Ward 6 ; observ'd every <pb facs="ppp.01876.0190.jpg"
                xml:id="leaf095v" n="8" type="verso"/> case in the Ward, without, I think, missing
              one ; gave perhaps from twenty to thirty persons, each one some little gift, such as
              oranges, apples, sweet crackers, figs, &#38;c.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">Thursday, Jan.</hi> 21.&#8212;Devoted the main part of the day to
              Armory Square Hospital ; went pretty thoroughly through Wards F, G, H, and I ; some
              fifty cases in each Ward. In Ward F supplied the men throughout with writing paper and
              stamp'd envelope each ; distributed in small portions, to proper subjects, a large jar
              of first-rate preserv'd berries, which had been donated to me by a lady&#8212;her own
              cooking. Found several cases I thought good subjects for small sums of money, which I
              furnish'd. (The wounded men often come up broke, and it helps their spirits to have
              even the small sum I give them.) My paper and envelopes all gone, but distributed a
              good lot of amusing reading matter ; also, as I thought judicious, tobacco, oranges,
              apples, &#38;c. Interesting cases in Ward I ; Charles Miller, bed No. 19, Company D,
              Fifty-third Pennsylvania, is only sixteen years of age, very bright, courageous boy,
              left leg amputated below the knee; next bed to him, another young lad very sick; gave
              each appropriate gifts. In the bed above, also, amputation of the left leg ; gave him
              a little jar of raspberries ; bed No. 1, this Ward, gave a small sum ; also to a
              soldier on crutches, sitting on his bed near.......(I am more and more surprised at
              the very great proportion of youngsters from fifteen to twenty-one in the army. I
              afterwards found a still greater proportion among the Southerners.)</p>

            <p>Evening, same day, went to see D. F. R., before alluded to; found him remarkably
              changed for the better; up and dress'd&#8212;quite a triumph ; he afterwards got well,
              and went back to his regiment.........Distributed in the Wards a quantity of
              note-paper, and forty or fifty stamp'd envelopes, of which I had recruited my stock,
              and the men were much in need.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">Fifty Hours Left Wounded on the Field</hi>.&#8212;Here is a case of
              a soldier I found among the crowded cots in the Patent Office. He likes to have some
              one to talk to, and we will listen to him. He got badly hit in his leg and side at
              Fredericksburgh that eventful Saturday, 13th of December. He lay the succeeding two
              days and nights helpless on the field, between the city and those grim terraces of
              batteries ; his company and regiment had been compell'd to leave him to his fate. To
              make matters worse, it happen'd he lay with his head slightly down hill, and could not
              help himself. At the end of some fifty hours he was brought off, with other wounded,
              under a flag of truce..........I ask him how the rebels treated him as he lay during
              those two days and nights within reach of them&#8212;whether they came to
              him&#8212;whether they abused him? He answers that several of the rebels, soldiers and
              others, came to him, at one time and another. <pb facs="ppp.01876.0191.jpg"

              roughly and sarcastically, but nothing worse. One middle-aged man, however, who seem'd
              to be moving around the field, among the dead and wounded, for benevolent purposes,
              came to him in a way he will never forget; treated our soldier kindly, bound up his
              wounds, cheer'd him, gave him a couple of biscuits, and a drink of whiskey and water ;
              ask'd him if he could eat some beef. This good Secesh, however, did not change our
              soldier's position, for it might have caused the blood to burst from the wounds,
              clotted and stagnated. Our soldier is from Pennsylvania; has had a pretty severe time
              ; the wounds proved to be bad ones. But he retains a good heart, and is at present on
              the gain.........(It is not uncommon for the men to remain on the field this way, one,
              two, or even four or five days.)</p>

              write, and myself, when call'd upon, write all sorts of letters for them, (including
              love letters, very tender ones.) Almost as I reel off this memoranda, I write for a
              new patient to his wife. M. de F., of the Seventeenth Connecticut, Company H, has just
              come up (February 17) from Windmill Point, and is received in Ward H, Armory Square.
              He is an intelligent looking man, has a foreign accent, black-eyed and hair'd, a
              Hebraic appearance. Wants a telegraphic message sent to his wife, New Canaan, Ct. I
              agree to send the message&#8212;but to make things sure, I also sit down and write the
              wife a letter, and despatch it to the post-office immediately, as he fears she will
              come on, and he does not wish her to, as he will surely get well.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">Wednesday, Feb. 4th</hi>. Visited Armory Square Hospital, went
              pretty thoroughly through Wards E and D. Supplied paper and envelopes to all who
              wish'd&#8212;as usual, found plenty of the men who needed those articles. Wrote
              letters. Saw and talk'd with two or three members of the Brooklyn Fourteenth.........A
              poor fellow in Ward D, with a fearful wound in a fearful condition, was having some
              loose splinters of bone taken from the neighborhood of the wound. The operation was
              long, and one of great pain&#8212;yet, after it was well commenced, the soldier bore
              it in silence. He sat up, propp'd&#8212;was much wasted&#8212;had lain a long time
              quiet in one position, (not for days only, but weeks,)&#8212;a bloodless,
              brown-skinn'd face, with eyes full of determination&#8212;belong'd to a New York
              regiment. There was an unusual cluster of surgeons, medical cadets, nurses, &#38;c.,
              around his bed&#8212;I <pb facs="ppp.01876.0192.jpg" xml:id="leaf096v" n="10"
                type="verso"/> thought the whole thing was done with tenderness, and done well.</p>

            <p>In one case, the wife sat by the side of her husband, his sickness, typhoid fever,
              pretty bad. In another, by the side of her son&#8212;a mother&#8212;she told me she
              had seven children, and this was the youngest. (A fine, kind, healthy, gentle mother,
              good-looking, not very old, with a cap on her head, and dress'd like home&#8212;what a
              charm it gave to the whole Ward.) I liked the woman nurse in Ward E&#8212;I noticed
              how she sat a long time by a poor fellow who just had, that morning, in addition to
              his other sickness, bad hemmorhage&#8212;she gently assisted him, reliev'd him of the
              blood, holding a cloth to his mouth, as he cough'd it up&#8212;he was so weak he could
              only just turn his head over on the pillow.</p>

            <p>One young New York man, with a bright, handsome face, had been lying several months
              from a most disagreeable wound, receiv'd at Bull Run. A bullet had shot him right
              through the bladder, hitting him front, low in the belly, and coming out back. He had
              suffer'd much&#8212;the water came out of the wound, by slow but steady quantities,
              for many weeks&#8212;so that he lay almost constantly in a sort of puddle&#8212;and
              there were other disagreeable circumstances. He was of good heart, however. At present
              comparatively comfortable ; had a bad throat, was delighted with a stick of horehound
              candy I gave him, with one or two other trifles.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">Feb</hi>. 23. I must not let the great Hospital at the Patent
              Office pass away without some mention. A few weeks ago the vast area of the second
              story of that noblest of Washington buildings, was crowded close with rows of sick,
              badly wounded and dying soldiers. They were placed in three very large apartments. I
              went there many times. It was a strange, solemn and, with all its features of
              suffering and death, a sort of fascinating sight. I go sometimes at night to soothe
              and relieve particular cases. Two of the immense apartments are fill'd with high and
              ponderous glass cases, crowded with models in miniature of every kind of utensil,
              machine or invention, it ever enter'd into the mind of man to conceive ; and with
              curiosities and foreign presents. Between these cases are lateral openings, perhaps
              eight feet wide, and quite deep, and in these were placed the sick ; besides a great
              long double row of them up and down through the middle of the hall. Many of them were
              very bad cases, wounds and amputations. Then there was a gallery running above the
              hall, in which there were beds also. It was, indeed, a curious scene at night, when
              lit up. The glass cases, the beds, the forms lying there, the gallery above, and the
              marble pavement under foot&#8212;the suffering, and the fortitude to bear it in
              various degrees&#8212;occasionally, from some, the groan that could not be
              repressed&#8212;sometimes a poor fellow dying, with emaciated face and glassy eye, the

              side, the doctor also there, but no friend, no relative&#8212;such were the sights but
              lately in the Patent Office. The wounded have since been removed from there, and it is
              now vacant again.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">The White House, by Moonlight&#8212;Feb. 24</hi>.&#8212;A spell of
              fine soft weather. I wander about a good deal, especially at night, under the moon.
              To-night took a long look at the President's House&#8212;and here is my splurge about
              it. The white portico&#8212;the brilliant gas-light shining&#8212;the palace-like
              portico&#8212;the tall, round columns, spotless as snow&#8212;the walls also&#8212;the
              tender and soft moonlight, flooding the pale marble, and making peculiar faint
              languishing shades, not shadows&#8212;everywhere too a soft transparent haze, a thin
              blue moon-lace, hanging in the night in the air&#8212;the brilliant and extra
              plentiful clusters of gas, on and around the facade, columns, portico,
              &#38;c.&#8212;everything so white, so marbly pure and dazzling, yet soft&#8212;the
              White House of future poems, and of dreams and dramas, there in the soft and copious
              moon&#8212;the pure and gorgeous front, in the trees, under the night-lights, under
              the lustrous flooding moon, full of reality, full of illusion&#8212;The forms of the
              trees, leafless, silent, in trunk and myriad-angles of branches, under the stars and
              sky&#8212;the White House of the land, the White House of the night, and of beauty and
              silence&#8212;sentries at the gates, and by the portico, silent, pacing there in blue
              overcoats&#8212;stopping you not at all, but eyeing you with sharp eyes, whichever way
              you move.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">An Army Hospital Ward</hi>.&#8212;Let me specialize a visit I made
              to the collection of barrack-like one-story edifices, call'd Campbell Hospital, out on
              the flats, at the end of the then horse-railway route, on Seventh street. There is a
              long building appropriated to each Ward. Let us go into Ward 6. It contains to-day, I
              should judge, eighty or a hundred patients, half sick, half wounded. The edifice is
              nothing but boards, well whitewash'd inside, and the usual slender-framed iron
              bedsteads, narrow and plain. You walk down the central passage, with a row on either
              side, their feet toward you, and their heads to the wall. There are fires in large
              stoves, and the prevailing white of the walls is reliev'd by some ornaments, stars,
              circles, &#38;c., made of evergreens. The view of the whole edifice and occupants can
              be taken at once, for there is no partition. You may hear groans, or other sounds of
              unendurable suffering, from two or three of the iron cots, but in the main there is
              quiet&#8212;almost a painful absence of demonstration ; but the pallid face, the
              dull'd eye, and the moisture on the lip, are demonstration enough. Most of these sick
              or hurt are evidently young fellows from the country, farmers' sons, and such like.
              Look at the fine large frames, the bright and broad countenances, and the many yet
              lingering proofs of strong constitution and physique. <pb facs="ppp.01876.0194.jpg"
                xml:id="leaf097v" n="12" type="verso"/> Look at the patient and mute manner of our
              American wounded, as they lie in such a sad collection ; representatives from all New
              England, and from New York and New Jersey and Pennsylvania&#8212;indeed, from all the
              States and all the cities&#8212;largely from the West. Most of them are entirely
              without friends or acquaintances here&#8212;no familiar face, and hardly a word of
              judicious sympathy or cheer, through their sometimes long and tedious sickness, or the
              pangs of aggravated wounds.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">A Connecticut Case</hi>. This young man in bed 25 is H. D. B., of
              the Twenty-seventh Connecticut, Company B. His folks live at Northford, near New
              Haven. Though not more than twenty-one, or thereabouts, he has knock'd much around the
              world, on sea and land, and has seen some fighting on both. When I first saw him he
              was very sick, with no appetite. He declined offers of money&#8212;said he did not
              need anything. As I was quite anxious to do something, he confess'd that he had a
              hankering for a good home-made rice pudding&#8212;thought he could relish it better
              than anything. At this time his stomach was very weak. (The doctor, whom I consulted,
              said nourishment would do him more good than anything ; but things in the hospital,
              though better than usual, revolted him.) I soon procured B. his rice-pudding. A
              Washington lady, (Mrs. O'C.), hearing his wish, made the pudding herself, and I took
              it up to him the next day. He subsequently told me he lived upon it for three or four
              days.......This B. is a good sample of the American Eastern young man&#8212;the
              typical Yankee. I took a fancy to him, and gave him a nice pipe, for a keepsake. He
              receiv'd afterwards a box of things from home, and nothing would do but I must take
              dinner with him, which I did, and a very good one it was.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">Two Brooklyn Boys</hi>.&#8212;Here in this same Ward are two young
              men from Brooklyn, members of the Fifty-first New York. I had known both the two as
              young lads at home, so they seem near to me. One of them, J. L., lies there with an
              amputated arm, the stump healing pretty well. (I saw him lying on the ground at
              Fredericksburgh last December, all bloody, just after the arm was taken off. He was
              very phlegmatic about it, munching away at a cracker in the remaining hand&#8212;made
              no fuss.) He will recover, and thinks and talks yet of meeting the Johnny Rebs.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">A Secesh Brave</hi>.&#8212;The brave, grand soldiers are not
              comprised in those of one side, any more than the other. Here is a sample of an
              unknown Southerner, a lad of seventeen. At the War Department, a few days ago, I
              witness'd a presentation of captured flags to the Secretary. Among others a soldier
              named Gaut, of the One Hundred and Fourth Ohio Volunteers, presented a rebel
              battle-flag, which one of the officers stated to me was borne to the mouth of our
              cannon and planted there by a boy but seventeen years of age, who <pb
                facs="ppp.01876.0195.jpg" xml:id="leaf098r" n="13" type="recto"/> actually
              endeavor'd to stop the muzzle of the gun with fence-rails. He was kill'd in the
              effort, and the flag-staff was sever'd by a shot from one of our men. (Perhaps, in
              that Southern boy of seventeen, untold in history, unsung in poems, altogether
              unnamed, fell as strong a spirit, and as sweet, as any in all time.)</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">The Wounded from Chancellorsville. May,</hi> '63.&#8212;As I write
              this, the wounded have begun to arrive from Hooker's command from bloody
              Chancellorsville. I was down among the first arrivals. The men in charge of them told
              me the bad cases were yet to come. If that is so I pity them, for these are bad
              enough. You ought to see the scene of the wounded arriving at the landing here foot of
              Sixth street, at night. Two boat loads came about half-past seven last night. A little
              after eight it rain'd a long and violent shower. The poor, pale, helpless soldiers had
              been debark'd, and lay around on the wharf and neighborhood anywhere. The rain was,
              probably, grateful to them ; at any rate they were exposed to it. The few torches
              light up the spectacle. All around&#8212;on the wharf, on the ground, out on side
              places&#8212;the men are lying on blankets, old quilts, &#38;c., with bloody rags
              bound round heads, arms, and legs. The attendants are few, and at night few outsiders
              also&#8212;only a few hard-worked transportation men and drivers. (The wounded are
              getting to be common, and people grow callous.) The men, whatever their condition, lie
              there, and patiently wait till their turn comes to be taken up. Near by, the
              ambulances are now arriving in clusters, and one after another is call'd to back up
              and take its load. Extreme cases are sent off on stretchers. The men generally make
              little or no ado, whatever their sufferings. A few groans that cannot be suppress'd,
              and occasionally a scream of pain as they lift a man into the ambulance........To day,
              as I write, hundreds more are expected, and to-morrow and the next day more, and so on
              for many days. Quite often they arrive at the rate of 1000 a day.</p>

                since</hi>.&#8212;We already talk of Histories of the War, (presently to
              accumulate)&#8212;yes&#8212;technical histories of some things, statistics, official
              reports, and so on&#8212;but shall we ever get histories of the <hi rend="italic"
                >real</hi> things ?.......There was part of the late battle at Chancellorsville,
              (second Fredericksbursh,) a little over a week ago. Saturday, Saturday night and
              Sunday, under Gen. Joe Hooker, I would like to give just a glimpse of&#8212;(a
              moment's look in a terrible storm at sea&#8212;of which a few suggestions are enough,
              and full details impossible.) The fighting had been very hot during the day, and after
              an intermission the latter part, was resumed at night, and kept up with furious energy
              till 3 o'clock in the morning. That afternoon (Saturday) an attack sudden and strong
              by Stonewall Jackson had <pb facs="ppp.01876.0196.jpg" xml:id="leaf098v" n="14"
                type="verso"/> gain'd a great advantage to the Southern army, and broken our lines,
              entering us like a wedge, and leaving things in that position at dark. But Hooker at
              11 at night made a desperate push, drove the Secesh forces back, restored his original
              lines, and resumed his plans. This night scrimmage was very exciting, and afforded
              countless strange and fearful pictures. The lighting had been general both at
              Chancellorsville and northeast at Fredericksburgh. (We hear of some poor fighting,
              episodes, skedaddling on our part. I think not of it. I think of the fierce bravery,
              the general rule.) One Corps, the 6th, Sedgewick's, fights four dashing and bloody
              battles in 36 hours, retreating in great jeopardy, losing largely and maintaining
              itself, fighting with the sternest desperation under all circumstances, getting over
              the Rappahannock only by the skin of its teeth, yet getting over. It lost many, many
              brave men, yet it took vengeance, ample vengeance.</p>

            <p>But it was the tug of Saturday evening, and through the night and Sunday morning, I
              wanted to make a special note of. It was largely in the woods, and quite a general
              engagement. The night was very pleasant, at times the moon shining out full and clear,
              all Nature so calm in itself, the early summer grass so rich, and foliage of the
              trees&#8212;yet there the battle raging, and many good fellows lying helpless, with
              new accessions to them, and every minute amid the rattle of muskets and crash of
              cannon, (for there was an artillery contest too,) the red life-blood oozing out from
              heads or trunks or limbs upon that green and dew-cool grass. The woods take fire, and
              many of the wounded, unable to move, (especially some of the divisions in the Sixth
              Corps,) are consumed&#8212;quite large spaces are swept over, burning the dead
              also&#8212;some of the men have their hair and beards singed&#8212;some, splatches of
              burns on their faces and hands others holes burnt in their clothing........The flashes
              of fire from the cannon, the quick flaring flames and smoke, and the immense
              roar&#8212;the musketry so general, the light nearly bright enough for each side to
              see one another&#8212;the crashing, tramping of men&#8212;the yelling&#8212;close
              quarters&#8212;we hear the Secesh yells&#8212;our men cheer loudly back, especially if
              Hooker is in sight&#8212;hand to hand conflicts, each side stands up to it, brave,

              to write newer greater poems on&#8212;and still the woods on fire&#8212;still many are
              not only scorch'd&#8212;too many, unable to move, are burn'd to death.........Then the
              camp of the wounded&#8212;O heavens, what scene is this ?&#8212;is this indeed <hi
                rend="italic">humanity</hi>&#8212;these butchers' shambles? There are several of
              them. There they lie, in the largest, in an open space in the woods, from 500 to 600
              poor fellows&#8212;the groans and screams&#8212;the odor of blood, mixed with the
              fresh scent of the night, the <pb facs="ppp.01876.0197.jpg" xml:id="leaf099r" n="15"
                type="recto"/> grass, the trees&#8212;that Slaughter-house !&#8212;O well is it
              their mothers, their sisters cannot see them&#8212;cannot conceive, and never
              conceiv'd, these things.........One man is shot by a shell, both in the arm and
              leg&#8212;both are amputated&#8212;there lie the rejected members. Some have their
              legs blown off&#8212;some bullets through the breast&#8212;some indescribably horrid
              wounds in the face or head, all mutilated, sickening, torn, gouged out&#8212;some in
              the abdomen&#8212;some mere boys&#8212;here is one his face colorless as chalk, lying
              perfectly still, a bullet has perforated the abdomen&#8212;life is ebbing fast, there
              is no help for him. In the camp of the wounded are many rebels, badly hurt&#8212;they
              take their regular turns with the rest, just the same as any&#8212;the surgeons use
              them just the same.........Such is the camp of the wounded&#8212;such a fragment, a
              reflection afar off of the bloody scene&#8212;while over all the clear, large moon
              comes out at times softly, quietly shining.</p>

            <p>Such, amid the woods, that scene of flitting souls&#8212;amid the crack and crash and
              yelling sounds&#8212;the impalpable perfume of the woods&#8212;and yet the pungent,
              stifling smoke&#8212;shed with the radiance of the moon, the round, maternal queen,
              looking from heaven at intervals so placid&#8212;the sky so heavenly&#8212;the
              clear-obscure up there, those buoyant upper oceans&#8212;a few large placid stars
              beyond, coming out and then disappearing&#8212;the melancholy, draperied night above,
              around.......And there, upon the roads, the fields, and in those woods, that contest,
              never one more desperate in any age or land&#8212;both parties now in
              force&#8212;masses&#8212;no fancy battle, no semi-play, but fierce and savage demons
              fighting there&#8212;courage and scorn of death the rule, exceptions almost none.</p>

            <p>What history, again I say, can ever give&#8212;for who can know, the mad, determin'd
              tussle of the armies, in all their separate large and little squads&#8212;as
              this&#8212;each steep'd from crown to toe in desperate, mortal purports ? Who know the
              conflict hand-to-hand&#8212;the many conflicts in the dark, those shadowy-tangled,
              flashing-moonbeam'd woods&#8212;the writhing groups and squads&#8212;hear through the
              woods the cries, the din, the cracking guns and pistols&#8212;the distant
              cannon&#8212;the cheers and calls, and threats and awful music of the oaths&#8212;the
              indiscribable mix&#8212;the officers' orders, persuasions, encouragements&#8212;the
              devils fully rous'd in human hearts&#8212;the strong word, <hi rend="italic">Charge,
                men, charge</hi>&#8212;the flash of the naked sword, and many a flame and
              smoke&#8212;And still the broken, clear and clouded heaven&#8212;and still again the
              moonlight pouring silvery soft its radiant patches overall ?.........Who paint the
              scene, the sudden partial panic of the afternoon, at dusk ? Who paint the
              irrepressible advance of the Second Division of the Third Corps, under Hooker himself,
              suddenly order'd up&#8212;those rapid-filing phantoms through <pb
                facs="ppp.01876.0198.jpg" xml:id="leaf099v" n="16" type="verso"/> the woods ? Who
              show what moves there in the shadows, fluid and firm&#8212;to save, (and it did save,)
              the Army's name, perhaps the Nation ? And there the veterans hold the field. (Brave
              Berry falls not yet&#8212;but Death has mark'd him&#8212;soon he falls.)</p>

            <p>Of scenes like these, I say, who writes&#8212;who e'er can write, the story ? Of many
              a score&#8212;aye, thousands, North and South, of unwrit heroes, unknown heroisms,
              incredible, impromptu, first-class desperations&#8212;who tells ? No history,
              ever&#8212;No poem sings, nor music sounds, those bravest men of all&#8212;those
              deeds. No formal General's report, nor print, nor book in the library, nor column in
              the paper, embalms the bravest, North or South, East or West. Unnamed, unknown,
              remain, and still remain, the bravest soldiers. Our manliest&#8212;our boys&#8212;our
              hardy darlings. Indeed no picture gives them. Likely their very names are lost.
              Likely, the typic one of them, (standing, no doubt, for hundreds, thousands,) crawls
              aside to some bush-clump, or ferny tuft, on receiving his death-shot&#8212;there,
              sheltering a little while, soaking roots, grass and soil with red blood&#8212;the
              battle advances, retreats, flits from the scene, sweeps by&#8212;and there, haply with
              pain and suffering, (yet less, far less, than is supposed,) the last lethargy winds
              like a serpent round him&#8212;the eyes glaze in death&#8212;none recks&#8212;Perhaps
              the burial-squads, in truce, a week afterwards, search not the secluded spot&#8212;And
              there, at last, the Bravest Soldier crumbles in the soil of mother earth, unburied and
              unknown.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">June</hi> 18.&#8212;In one of the Hospitals I find Thomas Haley,
              Co. M, Fourth New York Cavalry&#8212;a regular Irish boy, a fine specimen of youthful
              physical manliness&#8212;shot through the lungs&#8212;inevitably dying&#8212;came over
              to this country from Ireland to enlist&#8212;has not a single friend or acquaintance
              here&#8212;is sleeping soundly at this moment, (but it is the sleep of
              death)&#8212;has a bullet-hole straight through the lung.......I saw Tom when first
              brought here, three days since, and didn't supppose he could live twelve
              hours&#8212;(yet he looks well enough in the face to a casual observer.) He lies there
              with his frame exposed above the waist, all naked, for coolness, a fine built man, the
              tan not yet bleach'd from his cheeks and neck. It is useless to talk to him, as with
              his sad hurt, and the stimulants they give him, and the utter strangeness of every
              object, face, furniture, &#38;c., the poor fellow, even when awake, is like a
              frighten'd, shy animal. Much of the time he sleeps, or half sleeps. (Sometimes I
              thought he knew more than be show'd.) I often come and sit by him in perfect silence ;
              he will breathe for ten minutes as softly and evenly as a young babe asleep. Poor
              youth, so handsome, athletic, with profuse beautiful shining hair. One time as I sat
              looking at him while he lay asleep, he suddenly, without the least start, awaken'd,
              open'd his <pb facs="ppp.01876.0199.jpg" xml:id="leaf100r" n="17" type="recto"/> eyes,
              gave me a long, long steady look, turning his face very slightly to gaze
              easier&#8212;one long, clear silent look&#8212;a slight sigh&#8212;then turn'd back
              and went into his doze again. Little he knew, poor death-stricken boy, the heart of
              the stranger that hover'd near.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">W. H. E., Co. .F., Second N. J.</hi>&#8212;His disease is
              pneumonia. He lay sick at the wretched hospital below Aquia Creek, for seven or eight
              days before brought here. He was detail'd from his regiment to go there and help as
              nurse ; but was soon taken down himself. Is an elderly, sallow-faced, rather gaunt,
              gray-hair'd man ; a widower,' with children. He express'd a great desire for good,
              strong, green tea. An excellent lady, Mrs. W., of Washington, soon sent him a package
              ; also a small sum of money. The doctor said give him the tea at pleasure ; it lay on
              the table by his side, and he used it every day. He slept a great deal ; could not
              talk much, as he grew deaf. Occupied bed 15, Ward I, Armory. (The same lady above,
              Mrs. W., sent the men a large package of tobacco.)</p>

            <p>J, G. lies in bed 52, Ward I ; is of Co. B, Seventh Pennsylvania. I gave him a small
              sum of money, some tobacco and envelopes. To a man adjoining, also gave 25 cents ; he
              flush'd in the face, when I offer'd it&#8212;refused at first, but as I found he had
              not a cent, and was very fond of having the daily papers, to read, I prest it on him.
              He was evidently very grateful, but said little.</p>

            <p>J. T. L., of Co. F., Ninth New Hampshire, lies in bed 37, Ward I. Is very fond of
              tobacco. I furnish him some ; also with a little money. Has gangrene of the feet, a
              pretty bad case ; will surely have to lose three toes. Is a regular specimen of an
              old-fashion'd, rude, hearty, New England country man, impressing me with his likeness
              to that celebrated singed cat, who was better than she look'd.</p>

            <p>Bed 3, Ward E, Armory, has a great hankering for pickles , something pungent . After
              consulting the doctor. I gave him a small bottle of horse-radish; also some apples ;
              also a book.........Some of the nurses are excellent. The woman nurse in this Ward I
              like very much. (Mrs. Wright&#8212;a year afterwards I found her in Mansion House
              Hospital, Alexandri&#8212;she is a perfect nurse.)</p>

            <p>In one bed a young man, Marcus Small, Co. K, Seventh Maine&#8212;sick with dysentery
              and typhoid fever&#8212;pretty critical, too&#8212;I talk with him often&#8212;he
              thinks he will die&#8212;looks like it indeed. I write a letter for him home to East
              Livermore, Maine&#8212;I let him talk to me a little, but not much, advise him to keep
              very quiet&#8212;do most of the talking myself&#8212;stay quite a while with him, as
              he holds on to my hand&#8212;talk to him in a cheering, but slow, low, and measured
              manner&#8212;talk about his furlough, and going home as soon as he is able to
              travel.</p>

              morphine, his face ashy and glazed, bright young eyes&#8212;give him a large handsome
              apple, tell him to have it roasted in the morning, as he generally feels easier then,
              and can eat a little breakfast. I write two letters for him.</p>

            <p>Opposite, an old Quaker lady is sitting by the side of her son, Amer Moore, Second U.
              S. Artillery&#8212;shot in the head two weeks since, very low, quite
              rational&#8212;from hips down, paralyzed&#8212;he will surely die. I speak a very few
              words to him every day and evening&#8212;he answers pleasantly&#8212;is a handsome
              fellow&#8212;wants nothing&#8212;(he told me soon after he came about his home
              affairs, his mother had been an invalid, and he fear'd to let her know his condition.)
              He died soon after she came.</p>

            <p>(In my visits to the Hospitals I found it was in the simple matter of Personal
              Presence, and emanating ordinary cheer and magnetism, that I succeeded and help'd more
              than by medical nursing, or delicacies, or gifts of money, or anything else. During
              the war I possess'd the perfection of physical health. My habit, when practicable, was
              to prepare for starting out on one of those daily or nightly tours, of from a couple
              to four or five hours, by fortifying myself with previous rest, the bath, clean
              clothes, a good meal, and as cheerful an appearance as possible.)</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">June</hi> 25, (<hi rend="italic">Thursday, Sundown</hi>).&#8212;As
              I sit writing this paragraph I see a train of about thirty huge four-horse wagons,
              used as ambulances, fill'd with wounded, passing up Fourteenth street, on their way,
              probably, to Columbian, Carver, and Mount Pleasant Hospitals. This is the way the men
              come in now, seldom in small numbers, but almost always in these long, sad
              processions. Through the past winter, while our army lay opposite Fredericksburgh, the
              like strings of ambulances were of frequent occurrence along Seventh street, passing
              slowly up from the steamboat wharf, with loads from Aquia Creek.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">Bad Wounds, the Young</hi>.&#8212;The soldiers are nearly all young
              men, and far more American than is generally supposed&#8212;I should say nine-tenths
              are native-born. Among the arrivals from Chancellorsville I find a large proportion of
              Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois men. As usual, there are all sorts of wounds. Some of the
              men fearfully burnt from the explosion of artillery caissons. One Ward has a long row
              of officers, some with ugly hurts. Yesterday was perhaps worse than usual. Amputations
              are going on&#8212;the attendants are dressing wounds. As you pass by, you must be on
              your guard where you look. I saw the other day a gentleman, a visitor apparently from
              curiosity, in one of the Wards, step and turn a moment to look at an awful wound they
              were <pb facs="ppp.01876.0201.jpg" xml:id="leaf101r" n="19" type="recto"/> probing,
              &#38;c. He turn'd pale, and in a moment he had fainted away and fallen on the
              floor.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">June</hi> 29.&#8212;Just before sundown this evening a very large
              cavalry force went by&#8212;a fine sight. The men evidently had seen service. First
              came a mounted band of sixteen bugles, drums and cymbals, playing wild martial
              tunes&#8212;made my heart jump. Then the principal officers, then company after
              company, with their officers at their heads, making of course the main part of the
              cavalcade ; then a long train of men with led horses, lots of mounted negroes with
              special horses&#8212;and a long string of baggage-waggons, each drawn by four
              horses&#8212;and then a motley rear guard. It was a pronouncedly warlike and gay show.
              The sabres clank 'd, the men look'd young and healthy and strong ; the electric
              tramping of so many horses on the hard road, and the gallant bearing, fine seat, and
              bright faced appearance of a thousand and more handsome young American men, were so
              good to see&#8212;quite set me up for hours.</p>

            <p>An hour later another troop went by, smaller in numbers, perhaps three hundred men.
              They too look'd like serviceable men, campaigners used to field and fight.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">July</hi> 3.&#8212;This forenoon, for more than an hour, again long
              strings of cavalry, several regiments, very fine men and horses, four or five abreast.
              I saw them in Fourteenth street, coming in town from north. Several hundred extra
              horses, some of the mares with colts, trotting along. (Appear'd to be a number of
              prisoners too.).........How inspiriting always the cavalry regiments ! Our men are
              generally well mounted, they ride well, feel good, are young, and gay on the saddle,
              their blankets in a roll behind them, their sabres clanking at their sides. This noise
              and movement and the tramp of many horses' hoofs has a curious effect upon one. The
              bugles play&#8212;presently you hear them afar off,deaden'd, mix'd with other
              noises.</p>

            <p>Then just as they had all pass'd, a string of ambulances commenced from the other
              way, moving up Fourteenth street north, slowly wending along, bearing a large lot of
              wounded to the hospitals.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">4th July&#8212;Battle of</hi> GETTYSBURG,&#8212;The weather to-day,
              upon the whole, is very fine, warm, but from a smart rain last night, fresh enough,
              and no dust, which is a great relief for this city. I saw the parade about noon,
              Pennsylvania avenue, from Fifteenth street down toward the Capitol. There were three
              regiments of infantry, (I suppose the ones doing patrol duty here,) two or three
              societies of Odd Fellows, a lot of children in barouches, and a squad of policemen.
              (It was a useless imposition upon the soldiers&#8212;they have work enough on their
              backs without piling the like of this.)</p>

            <p>As I went down the Avenue, saw a big flaring placard on <pb facs="ppp.01876.0202.jpg"
                xml:id="leaf101v" n="20" type="verso"/> the bulletin board of a newspaper office,
              announcing " Glorious Victory for the Union Army !" Meade had fought Lee at
              Gettysburgh, Pennsylvania, yesterday and day before, and repuls'd him most signally,
              taken 3,000 prisoners, &#38;c. (I afterwards saw Meade's despatch, very modest, and a
              sort of order of the day from the President himself, quite religious, giving thanks to
              the Supreme, and calling on the people to do the same, &#38;c.)</p>

            <p>I walk'd on to Armory Hospital&#8212;took along with me several bottles of blackberry
              and cherry syrup, good and strong, but innocent. Went through several of the Wards,
              announc'd to the soldiers the news from Meade, and gave them all a good drink of the
              syrups with ice water, quite refreshing.........Meanwhile the Washington bells are
              ringing their sundown peals for Fourth of July, and the usual fusillades of boys'
              pistols, crackers, and guns.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">A Cavalry Camp</hi>.&#8212;I am writing this nearly sundown,
              watching a Cavalry company, (acting Signal Service,) just come in through a shower,
              and making their night's camp ready on some broad, vacant ground, a sort of hill, in
              full view, opposite my window. There are the men in their yellow-striped jackets. All
              are dismounted ; the freed horses stand with drooping heads and wet sides. They are to
              be led off presently in groups, to water. The little wall-tents and shelter-tents
              spring up quickly. I see the fires already blazing, and pots and kettles over them.
              The laggards among the men are driving in tent-poles, wielding their axes with strong,
              slow blows. I see great huddles of horses, bundles of hay, men, (some with unbuckled
              sabres yet on their sides,) a few officers, piles of wood, the flames of the fires,
              comrades by two and threes, saddles, harness, &#38;c. The smoke streams upward,
              additional men arrive ana dismount&#8212;some drive in stakes, and tie their horses to
              them ; some go with buckets for water, some are chopping wood, and so on.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">July</hi> 6.&#8212;A steady rain, dark and thick and warm. A train
              of six-mule wagons has just pass'd bearing pontoons, great square-end flat-boats, and
              the heavy planking for overlaying them. We hear that the Potomac above here is
              flooded, and are wondering whether Lee will be able to get back across again, or
              whether Meade will indeed break him to pieces.</p>

            <p>The cavalry camp on the hill is a ceaseless field of observation for me. This
              forenoon there stand the horses, huddled, tether'd together, dripping, steaming,
              chewing their hay. The men emerge from their tents, dripping also. The fires are half
              quench'd.</p>

              boots, some laying off, reading, writing&#8212;some <pb facs="ppp.01876.0203.jpg"

              squads of horses tether'd, feeding, continually stamping and whisking their tails to
              keep off flies.......I sit long in my third story window and look at the scene&#8212;a
              hundred little things going on&#8212;or peculiar objects connected with the camp that
              could not be described, any one of them justly, without much minute drawing and
              coloring in words.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">A New York Soldier</hi>.&#8212;This afternoon, July 22, I have
              spent a long time with Oscar F. Wilber, Company G, One Hundred and Fifty-fourth New
              York, low with chronic diarrhoea, and a bad wound also. He ask'd me to read to him a
              chapter in the New Testament. I complied, and ask'd him what I should read. He said :
              " Make your own choice. " I open'd at the close of one of the first books of the
              Evangelists, and read the chapters describing the latter hours of Christ, and the
              scenes at the crucifixion. The poor, wasted young man ask'd me to read the following
              chapter also, how Christ rose again.. I read very slowly, for Oscar was feeble. It
              pleas'd him very much, yet the tears were in his eyes. He ask'd me if I enjoy'd
              religion. I said: " Perhaps not, my dear, in the way you mean, and yet, may-be, it is
              the same thing." He said : " It is my chief reliance. " He talk'd of death, and said
              he did not fear it. I said : " Why, Oscar, don't you think you will get well ?" He
              said : " I may, but it is not probable." He spoke calmly of his condition. The wound
              was very bad ; it discharg'd much. Then the diarrhea had prostrated him, and I felt
              that he was even then the same as dying. He behaved very manly and affectionate. The
              kiss I gave him as I was about leaving he return'd four fold. He gave me his mother's
              address, Mrs. Sally B. "Wilber, Alleghany Post-office, Cattaraugus County, N. Y. I had
              several such interviews with him. He died a few days after the one just described.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">Aug</hi>. 8.&#8212;To-night, as I was trying to keep cool, sitting
              by a wounded soldier in Armory Square, I was attracted by some pleasant singing in an
              adjoining Ward. As my soldier was asleep, I left him, and entering the Ward where the
              music was, I walk'd half way down and took a seat by the cot of a young Brooklyn
              friend, S. B., badly wounded in the hand at Chancellorsville, and who has suffer'd
              much, but who at that moment in the evening was wide awake and comparatively easy. He
              had turn'd over on his left side to get a better view of the singers, but the
              plentiful drapery of the musquito curtains of the adjoining cots obstructed the sight.
              I stept round and loop'd them all up, so that he had a clear show, and then sat down
              attain by him, and look'd and listened. The principal singer was a young lady nurse of
              one of the Wards, accompanying on a melodeon, and join 'd <pb
                facs="ppp.01876.0204.jpg" xml:id="leaf102v" n="22" type="verso"/> by the lady nurses
              of other Wards. They sat there, making a charming group, with their handsome, healthy
              faces ; and standing up a little behind them were some ten or fifteen of the
              convalescent soldiers, young men, nurses, &#38;c., with books in their hands, taking
              'part in the singing. Of course it was not such a performance as the great soloists at
              the New York Opera House take a hand in ; but I am not sure but I receiv'd as much
              pleasure, under the circumstances, sitting there, as I have had from the best Italian
              compositions, express'd by world-famous performers.......The scene was, indeed, an
              impressive one. The men lying up and down the hospital, in their cots, (some badly
              wounded&#8212;some never to rise thence,) the cots themselves, with their drapery of
              white curtains, and the shadows down the lower and upper parts of the Ward ; then the
              silence of the men, and the attitudes they took&#8212;the whole was a sight to look
              around upon again and again. And there, sweetly rose those female voices up to the
              high, whitewash'd wooden roof, and pleasantly the roof sent it all back again. They
              sang very well ; mostly quaint old songs and declamatory hymns, to fitting tunes.
              Here, for instance, is one of the songs they sang : <lg type="linegroup">
                <head type="main-authorial">SHINING SHORES</head>
                <l>My days are swiftly gliding by, and I a Pilgrim stranger,</l>
                <l>Would not detain them as they fly, those hours of toil and danger ;</l>
                <l>For O we stand on Jordan's strand, our friends are passing over,</l>
                <l>And just before, the shining shores we may almost discover.</l>
              </lg>
              <lg type="linegroup">
                <l>We'll gird our loins my brethren dear, our distant home discerning,</l>
                <l>Our absent Lord has left us word, let every lamp be burning,</l>
                <l>For O we stand on Jordan's strand, our friends are passing over,</l>
                <l>And just before, the shining shores we may almost discover.</l>
              </lg>
            </p>

            <p>As the strains reverberated through the great edifice of boards, (an excellent place
              for musical performers,) it was plain to see how it all sooth'd and was grateful to
              the men. I saw one near me turn over, and bury his face partially in his pillow ; he
              was probably ashamed to be seen with wet eyes.</p>

              12.&#8212;I see the President almost every day, as I happen to live where he passes to
              or from his lodgings out of town. He never sleeps at the White House during the hot
              season, but has quarters at a healthy location, some three miles north of the city,
              the Soldiers' Home, a United States military establishment. I saw him this morning
              about 8&#189; coming in to business, riding on Vermont avenue, near L street. The
              sight is a significant one, (and different enough from how and where I first saw
                him.<ref xml:id="r019" target="#n019">&#42;</ref>) He always has a </p>

                time I saw Abraham Lincoln. It must have been about the 18th or 19th of February,
                1861. It was rather a pleasant spring afternoon, in New York city, as Lincoln
                arrived there from the West to stop a few hours and then pass on to Washington, to
                prepare for his inaugura-tion. I saw him in Broadway, near the site of the present
                Post-office. He had come down, I think, from Canal street, to stop at the Astor
                House. The broad spaces, sidewalks, and street in the nieghborhood, and for some
                distance, were</note>

              twenty-five or thirty cavalry, with sabres drawn, and held upright over their
              shoulders. The party makes no great show in uniforms or horses. Mr. Lincoln, on the
              saddle, generally rides a good-sized easy-going gray horse, is dress'd in plain black,
              somewhat rusty and dusty ; wears a black stiff hat, and looks about as ordinary in
              attire, &#38;c., as the commonest man. A Lieutenant, with yellow straps, rides at his
              left, and following behind, two by two, come the cavalry men in their yellow-striped
              jackets. They are generally going at a slow trot, as that is the pace set them by the
              One they wait upon. The sabres and accoutrements clank, and the entirely unornamental
                <hi rend="italic">cortege</hi> as it trots towards Lafayette square, arouses no
              sensation, only some curious stranger stops and gazes. I see very plainly A<hi
                rend="smallcaps">BRAHAM</hi> L<hi rend="smallcaps">INCOLN'S</hi> dark brown face,
              with the deep cut lines, the eyes, &#38;c., always to me with a deep latent sadness in
              the expression. We have got so that we always exchange bows, and very cordial
              ones.</p>

            <p>Sometimes the President goes and comes in an open barouche. The cavalry always
              accompany him, with drawn sabres. Often I notice as he goes out evenings&#8212;and
              sometimes in the morning, when he returns early&#8212;he turns off and halts at the
              large and handsome residence of the Secretary of War, on K street, and holds
              conference there. If in his barouche, I can see from my window he does not alight, but
              sits in the vehicle, and Mr. Stanton comes out to attend him. Sometimes one of his
              sons, a boy of ten or twelve, accompanies him, riding at his right on a pony.</p>

              <note> crowded with solid masses of people, many thousands. The omnibus and vehicles
                had been all turn'd off, leaving an unusual hush in that busy part of the city.
                Presently two or three shabby hack barouches made their way with some difficulty
                throw the crowd, and drew up at the Astor House entrance. A tall figure step'd out
                of the centre of these barouches, paus'd leisurey on the sidewalk,looked up at the
                dark granite walls and looming architecture of the grand old hotel&#8212;then, after
                a relieving stretch of arms and legs, turn'd round for over a minute to slowly and
                good-humoredly scan the appearnaces of the vast and silent crowds&#8212;and so, with
                very moderate pace, and accompanied by a few unknown-looking persons, ascended the
                portico steps.</note>
              <note>The figure, the look, the gait, are distinctly impress'd upon me yet; the
                unusual and uncouth height, the dress of complete black, the stovepipe hat push'd
                back on the head, the dark-brown complexion, the seam'd and wrinkled yet
                canny-looking face, the black, bushy head of hair, the disproportionately long neck,
                and the hands held behind as he stood observing the people. All was comparative and
                omnious silence. The new comer look'd with curiosty upon that immense sea of faces,
                and the sea of faces return'd the look with similar curiosity. In both there was a
                dash of something comical. Yet there was much anxiety in certain quarters. Cautious
                persons had fear'd that there would be some outbreak, some mark'd indignity or
                insult to the Presi-dent elect on his passage through the city, for he possess'd no
                personal pop-ularity in New York, and not much political. No such outbreak or
                insult, how-ever, occur'd. Only the silence of the crowd was very significant to
                those who were accustom'd to the usual demonstrations of New York in wild, tumultuos
                hurrahs&#8212;the deafening tumults of welcome, and the thunder-shouts of pack'd

              toward the latter part of the afternoon, out in a barouche, on a pleasure ride through
              the city. Mrs. Lincoln was dress'd in complete black, with a long crape veil. The
              equipage is of the plainest kind, only two horses, and they nothing extra. They pass'd
              me once very close, and I saw the President in the face fully, as they were moving
              slow, and his look, though abstracted, happen'd to be directed steadily in my eye. He
              bow'd and smiled, but far beneath his smile I noticed well the expression I have
              alluded to. None of the artists or pictures have caught the deep, though subtle and
              indirect expression of this man's face. There is something else there. One of the
              great portrait painters of two or three centuries ago is needed.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">Heated term</hi>.&#8212;There has lately been much suffering here
              from heat. We have had it upon us now eleven days. I go around with an umbrella and a
              fan. I saw two cases of sun-stroke yesterday, one in Pennsylvania avenue, and another
              in Seventh street. The City Railroad Company loses some horses every day. Yet
              Washington is having a livelier August, and is probably putting in a more energetic
              and satisfactory summer, than ever before during its existence. There is probably more
              human electricity, more population to make it, more business, more light-heartedness,
              than ever before. The armies that swiftly circumambiated from Fredericksburgh,
              march'd, struggled, fought, had out their mighty clinch and hurl at Gettysburgh,
              wheel'd, have circumambiated again, return'd to their ways, touching us not, either at
              their going or coming. And Washington feels that she has pass'd the worst ; perhaps
              feels that she is henceforth mistress. So here she sits with her surrounding hills and
              shores spotted with guns ; and is conscious of a character and identity different from
              what it was five or six short weeks ago, and very considerably pleasanter and
              prouder.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">Soldiers and Talks</hi>. Soldiers, soldiers, soldiers, you meet
              everywhere about the city, often superb looking men, though invalids dress'd in worn
              uniforms, and carrying canes or crutches. I often have talks with them, occasionally
              quite long and interesting. One, for instance, will have been all through the
              Peninsula under McClellan&#8212;narrates to me the fights, the marches, the strange,
              quick changes of that eventful campaign, and gives glimpses of many things untold in
              any official reports or books or journals. These, indeed, are the things that are
              genuine and precious. The man was there, has been out two years, has been through a
              dozen fights, the superfluous flesh of talking is long work'd off him, and now he
              gives me little but the hard meat and sinew.......I find it refreshing, these hardy,
              bright, intuitive, American young men, (experienced soldiers with all their youth.)
              The vital play and significance moves one more than books. Then there hangs something

              man who has borne his part in battles, especially if he is very quiet regarding it
              when you desire him to unbosom. I am continually lost at the absence of blowing and
              blowers among these old-young American militaires. I have found some man or another
              who has been in every battle since the War began, and have talk'd-with them about each
              one, in every part of the United States, and many of the engagements on the rivers and
              harbors too. I find men here from every State in the Union, without exception. (There
              are more Southerners, especially Border State men, in the Union army than is generally
              supposed.) I now doubt whether one can get a fair idea of what this War practically
              is, or what genuine America is, and her character, without some such experience as
              this I am having.</p>

              scene of that dark and bloody 1863, from notes of my visit to Armory Square Hospital,

              Lieutenant of one of the Wisconsin regiments. Tread the bare board floor lightly here,
              for the pain and panting of death are in this cot ! I saw the Lieutenant when he was
              first brought here from Chancellorsville, and have been with him occasionally from day
              to day, and night to night. He had been getting along pretty well, till night before
              last, when a sudden hemorrhage that could not be stopt came upon him, and to-day it
              still continues at intervals. Notice that water-pail by the side of the bed, with a
              quantity of blood and bloody pieces of muslin&#8212;nearly full ; that tells the
              story. The poor young man is lying panting, struggling painfully for breath, his great
              dark eyes with a glaze already upon them, and the choking faint but audible in his
              throat. An attendant sits by him, and will not leave him till the last; yet little or
              nothing can be done. He will die here in an hour or two without the presence of kith
              or kin. Meantime the ordinary chat and business of the Ward a little way off goes on
              indifferently. Some of the inmates are laughing and joking, others are playing
              checkers or cards, others are reading, &#38;c. (I have noticed through most of the
              hospitals that as long as there is any chance for a man, no matter how bad he maybe,
              the surgeon and nurses work hard, sometimes with curious tenacity, for his life, doing
              everything, and keeping somebody by him to execute the doctor's orders, and minister
              to him every minute night and day.........See that screen there. As you advance
              through the dusk of early candle-light, a nurse will step forth on tip-toe, and
              silently but imperiously forbid you to make any noise, or perhaps to come near at all.
              Some soldier's life is nickering there, suspended between recovery and death. Perhaps
              at this moment the exhausted frame has just fallen into a light sleep that a step
              might shake. You must retire. The neighboring patients <pb facs="ppp.01876.0208.jpg"
                xml:id="leaf104v" n="26" type="verso"/> must move in their stocking feet. I have
              been several times struck with such mark'd efforts&#8212;everything bent to save a
              life from the very grip of the destroyer. But when that grip is once firmly fix'd,
              leaving no hope or chance at all, the surgeon abandons the patient. If it is a case
              where stimulus is any relief, the nurse gives milk-punch or brandy, or whatever is
              wanted, <hi rend="italic">ad libitum</hi>. There is no fuss made. Not a bit of
              sentimentalism or whining have I seen about a single death-bed in hospital or on the
              field, but generally impassive indifference. All is over, as far as any efforts can
              avail ; it is useless to expend emotions or labors. While there is a prospect they
              strive hard at least most surgeons do; but death certain and evident, they yield the
              field.)</p>

                Hospitals.</hi>&#8212;I am in the habit of going to all, and to Fairfax Seminary,
              Alexandria, and over Long Bridge to the great Convalescent Camp, &#38;c. The journals
              publish a regular directory of them&#38;a long list. As a specimen of almost any one
              of the larger of these Hospitals, fancy to yourself a space of three to twenty acres
              of ground, on which are group'd ten or twelve very large wooden barracks, with,
              perhaps, a dozen or twenty, and sometimes more than that number, of small buildings,
              capable altogether of accommodating from five hundred to a thousand or fifteen hundred
              persons. Sometimes these wooden barracks or Wards, each of them, perhaps, from a
              hundred to a hundred and fifty feet long, are ranged in a straight row, evenly
              fronting the street ; others are planned so as to form an immense V ; and others again
              are ranged around a hollow square. They make altogether a huge cluster, with the
              additional tents, extra wards for contagious diseases, guard-houses, sutler's stores,
              chaplain's house, &#38;c. In the middle will probably be an edifice devoted to the
              offices of the Surgeon in Charge, and the Ward Surgeons, principal attaches, clerks,
              &#38;c. Then around this centre radiate or are gathered the Wards for the wounded and
              sick. The Wards are either letter'd alphabetically, Ward G, Ward K, or else
              numerically, 1,2,3, &#38;c. Each has its Ward Surgeon and corps of nurses. Of course,
              there is, in the aggregate, quite a muster of employes, and over all the Surgeon in
              Charge.</p>

            <p>The newspaper reader off through the agricultural regions, East or West, sees
              frequent allusions to these Hospitals, but has probably no clear idea of them. Here in
              Washington, when they are all fill'd, (as they have been already several times,) they
              contain a population more numerous in itself than the whole of the Washington of ten
              or fifteen years ago. Within sight of the Capitol, as I write, are some fifty or sixty
              such collections or camps, at times holding from fifty to seventy thousand men.
              Looking from any eminence and studying the topography in my rambles, I use <pb
                facs="ppp.01876.0209.jpg" xml:id="leaf105r" n="27" type="recto"/> them as landmarks.
              Through the rich August verdure of the trees see that white group of buildings off
              yonder in the outskirts ; then another cluster half a mile to the left of the first;
              then another a mile to the right, and another a mile beyond, and still another between
              us and the first. Indeed, we can hardly look in any direction but these grim clusters
              are dotting the beautiful landscape and environs. That little town, as you might
              suppose it, off there on the brow of a hill, is indeed a town, but of wounds,
              sickness, and death. It is Finley Hospital, northeast of the city, on Kendall Green,
              as it used to be call'd. That other is (Campbell Hospital. Both are large
              establishments. I have known these two alone to have from two thousand to twenty-five
              hundred inmates. Then there is Carver Hospital, larger still, a wall'd and military
              city regularly laid out, and guarded by squads of sentries. Again, offcast, Lincoln
              Hospital, a still larger one; and half a mile further Emory Hospital. Still sweeping
              the eye around down the river toward Alexandria, we see, to the right, the locality
              where the Convalescent Camp stands, with its five, eight, or sometimes ten thousand
              inmates. Even all these are but a portion. The Hare wood, Mount Pleasant, Armory
              Square, Judiciary Hospitals, are some of the rest, already mention'd, and all of them
              large collections.</p>

              (I had been on self-imposed duty some five hours, pretty closely confined,) I wander'd
              a long time around Washington. The night was sweet, very clear, sufficiently cool, a
              voluptuous half-moon slightly golden, the space near it of a transparent tinge. I
              walk'd up Pennsylvania Avenue, and then to Seventh street, and a long while round the
              Patent Office. Somehow it look'd rebukefully strong, majestic, there in the delicate
              moonlight. The sky, the planets, the constellations all so bright, so calm, so
              expressively silent, so soothing, after those Hospital scenes. I wander'd to and fro
              till the moist moon set, long after midnight.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">Spiritual Characters Among the Soldiers</hi>.&#8212;Every now and
              then in Hospital or Camp, there are beings I meet&#8212;specimens of unworldliness,
              disinterestedness and animal purity and heroism&#8212;perhaps some unconscious
              Indianian, or from Ohio or Tennessee&#8212;on whose birth the calmness of heaven seems
              to have descended, and whose gradual growing up, whatever the circumstances of
              work-life or change, or hardship, or small or no education that attended it, the power
              of a strange, spiritual sweetness, fibre and inward health have also attended.
              Something veil'd and abstracted is often a part of the manners of these beings. I have
              met them, I say, not seldom in the Army, in Camp, and in the great Hospitals. The

              immense droves of cattle, with their drivers, passing through the streets of the city.
              Some of the men have a way of leading the cattle on by a peculiar call, a wild,
              pensive hoot, quite musical, prolong'd, indescribable, sounding something between the
              coo of a pigeon and the hoot of an owl. I like to stand and look at the sight of one
              of these immense droves&#8212;a little way off&#8212;(as the dust is great.) There are

              confusion of this great army of sick, it is almost impossible for a stranger to find
              any friend or relative, unless he has the patient's address to start upon. Besides the
              directory printed in the newspapers here, there are one or two general directories of
              the Hospitals kept at Provost's headquarters, but they are nothing like complete ;
              they are never up to date, and, as things are, with the daily streams of coming and
              going and changing, cannot be. (I have known cases, for instance, such as a farmer
              coming here from Northern New York to find a wounded brother, faithfully hunting round
              for a week, and then compell'd to leave and go home without getting any trace of him.
              When he got nome he found a letter from the brother giving the right address in a
              hospital in Seventh street here.)</p>

            <p>CULPEPPER, VA., <hi rend="italic">Feb</hi>., '64.&#8212;Here I am, pretty well down
              toward the extreme front. Three or four days ago General S., who is now in chief
              command, (I believe Meade is absent sick,) moved a strong force southward from camp as
              if intending business. They went to the Rapidan ; there has since been some
              maneuvering and a little fighting, but nothing of consequence. The telegraphic
              accounts given Monday morning last, make entirely too much of it, I should say. What
              General S. intended we here know not, but we trust in that competent commander. We
              were somewhat excited, (but not so very much either,) on Sunday, during the day and
              night, as orders were sent out to pack up and <choice>

              ready to evacuate, to fall back toward Washington. I was very sleepy, and went to bed.
              Some tremendous shouts arousing me during the night, I went forth and found it was
              from the men above mention'd, who were returning. I talked with some of the men. As
              usual I found them full of gayety, endurance, and many fine little outshows, the signs
              of the most excellent good manliness of the world.......It was a curious sight to see
              those shadowy columns moving through the night. I stood unobserv'd in the darkness and
              watch'd them long. The mud was very deep. The men had their usual burdens, overcoats,
              knapsacks, guns and blankets. Along and along they filed by me, with often a laugh, a
              song, a cheerful word, but never once a murmur. It may have been odd, but I never
              before so realized the majesty and reality of the American common people proper. It
              fell upon me like a great awe. The strong ranks moved neither fast nor slow. They had
              march'd seven or eight miles already through the slipping, unctious mud. The brave
              First Corps stopt here. The equally braye Third Corps moved on to Brandy Station.</p>

            <p>The famous Brooklyn 14th are here, guarding the town. You see their red legs actively
              moving everywhere. Then they have a theatre of their own here. They give musical
              performances, nearly every thing done capitally. Of course the audience is a jam. It
              is real good sport to attend one of these entertainments of the 14th. I like to look
              around at the soldiers, and the general collection of eager and handsome young faces
              in front of the curtain, more than the scene on the stage.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">Paying the Bounties</hi>.&#8212;One of the things to note here now
              is the arrival of the paymaster with his strong box, and the payment of bounties to
              veterans re-enlisting. Major H. is here to-day, with a small mountain of greenbacks,
              rejoicing the hearts of the 2d division of the 1st Corps. In the midst of a ricketty
              shanty, behind a little table, sit the Major and Clerk Eldridge, with the rolls before
              them , and much moneys. A re-enlisted man gets in cash about $200 down, (and heavy
              instalments following, as the pay-days arrive, one after another. The show of the men
              crowding around is quite exhilarating. I like well to stand and look. They feel
              elated, their pockets full, and the ensuing furlough, the visit home. It is a scene of
              sparkling eyes and flush'd cheeks. The soldier has many gloomy and harsh experiences,
              and this makes up for some of them. Major H. is order'd to pay first all the
              re-enlisted men of the 1st Corps their bounties and back pay, and then the rest. You
              hear the peculiar sound of the rustling of the new and crisp greenbacks by the hour,
              through the nimble fingers of the Major and my friend Clerk E.</p>

              to be ready to start, I have heard since that the said orders came from some cautious
              minor commander, and that the high principalities knew not and thought not of any such
              move ; which is likely. The rumor and fear here intimated a long circuit by Lee, and
              flank attack on our right. But I cast my eyes at the mud, which was then at its
              highest and palmiest condition, and retired composedly to rest. Still it is about time
              for Culpepper to have a change. Authorities have chased each other here like clouds in
              a stormy sky. Before the first Bull Run this was the rendezvous and camp of
              instruction of the Secession troops. I am stopping at the house of a lady who has
              witness'd all the eventful changes of the War, along this route of contending armies.
              She is a widow, with a family of young children, and lives here with her sister in a
              large handsome house. A number of army officers board with them.</p>

              as Virginia is, wherever I move across her surface, I find myself rous'd to surprise
              and admiration. What capacity for products, improvements, human life, Nourishment and
              expansion ! Everywhere that I have been in the Old Dominion, (the subtle mockery of
              that title now !) such thoughts have fill'd me. The soil is yet far above the average
              of any of the northern States. And how full of breadth is the scenery, everywhere with
              distant mountains, everywhere convenient rivers. Even yet prodigal in forest woods,
              and surely eligible for all the fruits, orchards, and flowers. The skies and
              atmosphere most luscious, as I feel certain, from more than a year's residence in the
              State, and movements hither and yon. I should say very healthy, as a general thing.
              Then a rich and elastic quality, by night and by day. The sun rejoices in his
              strength, dazzling and burning, and yet, to me, never unpleasantly weakening. It is
              not the panting tropical heat, but invigorates. The north tempers it. The nights are
              often unsurpassable. Last evening (Feb. 8,) I saw the first of the new moon, the old
              moon clear along with it ; the sky and air so clear, such transparent hues of color,
              it seem'd to me I had never really seen the new moon before. It was the thinnest cut
              crescent possible. It hung delicate just above the sulky shadow of the Blue Mountains.
              Ah, if it might prove an omen and good prophecy for this unhappy State.</p>

              Washington, on my regular daily and nightly rounds. Of course there are many
              specialties. Dotting a Ward here and there are always cases of poor fellows,
              long-suffering under obstinate wounds, or weak and dishearten'd from typhoid fever, or
              the like ; mark'd cases, needing special and sympathetic nourishment. These I sit down
              and either talk to, or silently cheer them up. They always like it hugely, (and so <pb

              has its peculiarities, and needs some new adaptation. I have learnt to thus
              conform&#8212;learnt a good deal of hospital wisdom. Some of the poor young chaps,
              away from home for the first time in their lives, hunger and thirst for affection.
              This is sometimes the only thing that will reach their condition.......The men like to
              have a pencil, and something to write in. I have given them cheap pocket-diaries, and
              almanacs for 1864, interleav'd with blank paper. For reading I generally have some old
              pictorial magazines or story papers&#8212;they are always acceptable. Also the morning
              or evening papers of the day. The best books I do not give, but <hi rend="italic"

              reading to the men. They were very fond of it, and liked declamatory poetical pieces.
              We would gather in a large group by ourselves, after supper, and spend the time in
              such readings, or in talking, and occasionally by an amusing game called the Game of

              plain to me out of the events of the War, North and South, and out of all
              considerations, that the current Military theory, practice, rules and organization,
              (adopted from Europe from the feudal institutes, with, of course, the "modern
              improvements," largely from the French,) though tacitly follow'd, and believ'd in by
              the officers generally, are not at all consonant with the United States, nor our
              people, nor our days.....What it will be I know not&#8212;but I know that as entire an
              abnegation of the present Military System, (and the Naval too,) and a building up from
              radically different root-bases and centres appropriate to us, must eventually result,
              as that our Political system has resulted and become establish'd, different from
              feudal Europe, and built up on itself from original, perennial, democratic
              premises.</p>

            <p>We have undoubtedly in the United States the greatest Military power&#8212;an

              realities of such cases, (many, many happen'd,) as the one I am now going to
              mention.......Stewart C. Glover, Co. E, Fifth Wisconsin&#8212;was wounded, May 5, in
              one of those fierce tussles of the Wilderness&#8212;died May 21&#8212;aged about 20.

              an ideal American, of common life, of his age. He had serv'd nearly three years, and
              would have been entitled to his discharge in a few days. He was in Hancock's
              Corps.).......The fighting had about ceas'd for the day, and the General commanding

              Wisconsin, after the War broke out, and there enlisted&#8212;soon took to
              soldier-life, liked it, was very manly, was belov'd by officers and comrades.......He
              kept a little diary, like so many of the soldiers. On the day of his death, he wrote
              the following in it : <hi rend="italic">Today, the doctor says I must die&#8212;all is

              critical case, now lying in a half lethargy. Near where I sit is a suffering rebel,
              from the Eighth Louisiana ; his name is Irving. He has been here a long time, badly
              wounded, and lately had his leg amputated. It is not doing very well. Right opposite
              me is a sick soldierboy, laid down with his clothes on, sleeping, looking much wasted,
              his pallid face on his arm. I see by the yellow trimming on his jacket that he is a
              cavalry boy. He looks so handsome as he sleeps, one must needs go nearer to him. I
              step softly over and find by his card that he is named William Cone, of the First
              Maine Cavalry, and his folks live in Skowhegan.</p>

              rebel soldier, of large size, evidently a young man, was mortally wounded in top of
              the head, so that the brains partially exuded. He lived three days, lying on his back
              on the spot where he first dropt. He dug with his heel in the ground during that time
              a hole big enough to put in a couple of ordinary knapsacks. He just lay there in the
              open air, and with little intermission kept his heel going night and day. Some of our
              soldiers then moved him to a house, but he died in a few minutes.</p>

              we repuls'd about a score of vehement rebel charges, they left a great many wounded on
              the ground, mostly within our range. Whenever any of these wounded attempted to move
              away by any means, generally by crawling off, our men without exception, brought them
              down by a bullet. They let none crawl away, no matter what his condition.</p>

              October evening into Thirteenth street, a soldier with knapsack and overcoat on, stood
              at the corner inquiring his way. I found he wanted to go part of the road in my
              direction, so we walk'd on together. We soon fell into conversation. He was small and
              not very young, and a tough little fellow, as I judged in the evening light, catching
              glimpses by the lamps we pass'd. His answers were short, but clear. His name was
              Charles Carroll ; he belong'd to one of the Massachusetts regiments, and was born in
              or near Lynn. His parents were living, but were very old. There were four sons, and
              all had enlisted. Two had died of starvation and misery in the prison at
              Andersonville, and one had been kill'd in the West. He only was left. He was now going
              home, and, by the way he talk'd, I inferr'd that his time was nearly out. He made
              great calculations on being with his parents to comfort them the rest of their
              days.</p>

              Pamlico Sound&#8212;though a Southerner, a firm Union man&#8212;was captur'd Feb. 17,
              1863, and has been nearly two years in the Confederate prisons ; was at one time
              order'd releas'd by Governor Vance, but a rebel officer re-arrested him ; then sent on
              to Richmond for exchange&#8212;but instead of being exchanged was sent down (as a
              Southern citizen, not a soldier,) to Salisbury, N. C., where he remained until lately,
              when he escaped among the exchanged by assuming the name of a dead soldier, and coming
              up via Wilmington with the rest. Was about <pb facs="ppp.01876.0216.jpg"
                xml:id="leaf108v" n="34" type="verso"/> sixteen months in Salisbury. Subsequent to
              October '64, there were about 11,000 Union prisoners in the stockade ; about 100 of
              them Southern Unionists, 200 U. S. deserters. During the past winter 1500 of the
              prisoners, to save their lives, join'd the Confederacy, on condition of being assign'd
              merely to guard duty, &#38;c. Out of the 11,000 not more than 2,500 came out ; 500 of
              these were pitiable, helpless wretches&#8212;the rest were in a condition to travel.
              There were often 60 dead bodies to be buried in the morning ; the daily average would
              be about 40. The regular food was a meal of corn, the cob and husk ground together,
              and sometimes once a week a ration of sorghum molasses. A diminutive ration of meat
              might possibly come once a month, not oftener.......In the stockade, containing the
              11,000 men, there was a partial show of tents, (not enough for 2,000.) A large
              proportion of the men lived in holes in the ground, in the utmost wretchedness. Some
              froze to death, others had their hands and feet frozen. The rebel guards would
              occasionally, and on the least pretence, fire into the prison from mere demonism and
              wantonness. All the horrors that can be named, cruelty, starvation, lassitude, filth,
              vermin, despair, swift loss of self-respect, idiocy, insanity, and frequent murder,
              were there.......Stansbury has a wife and child living in Newbern&#8212;has written to

              our own deserters, (over 300) surrounded with a strong cordon of arm'd guards,
              marching along Pennsylvania avenue. The most motley collection I ever saw, all sorts
              of rig, all sorts of hats and caps, many fine-looking young fellows, some of them
              shame-faced, some sickly, most of them dirty, shirts very dirty and long worn, &#38;c.
              They tramp'd along without order, a huge huddling mass, not in ranks. I saw some of
              the spectators laughing, but I felt like anything else but laughing.</p>

            <p>These deserters are far more numerous than would be thought. Almost every day I see
              squads of them, sometimes two or three at a time, with a small guard ; sometimes ten
              or twelve, under a larger one. (I hear that desertions from the army now in the field
              have often averaged 10,000 a month. One of the commonest sights in Washington is a
              squad of deserters. I often think it curious that the military and civil operations do
              not clash, but they never do here.)</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">A Glimpse of War's Hell-Scenes</hi>.&#8212;In one of the late
              movements of our troops in the Valley, (near Upperville, I think,) a strong force of
              Moseby's mounted guerillas attack'd a train of wounded, and the guard of cavalry
              convoying them. The ambulances contain'd about 60 wounded, quite a number of them
              officers of rank. The rebels were in strength, and the capture of the train and its
              partial guard after a short snap was effectually accomplish'd.</p>

            <p>No sooner had our men surrender'd, the rebels instantly commenced robbing the train,
              and murdering their prisoners, even the wounded. Here is the scene, or a sample of it,
              ten minutes after. Among the wounded officers in the ambulances were one, a Lieutenant
              of regulars, and another of higher rank. These two were dragg'd out on the ground on
              their backs, and were now surrounded by the guerillas, a demoniac crowd, each member
              of which was stabbing them in different parts of their bodies. One of the officers had
              his feet pinn'd firmly to the ground by bayonets stuck through them and thrust into
              the ground. These two officers, as afterwards found on examination, had receiv'd about
              twenty such thrusts, some of them through the mouth, face, &#38;c. The wounded had all
              been dragg'd (to give a better chance also for plunder,) out of their wagons ; some
              had been effectually dispatch'd, and their bodies lying there lifeless and bloody.
              Others, not yet dead, but horribly mutilated, were moaning or groaning. Of our men who
              surrender'd, most had been thus maim'd or slaughter'd.</p>

            <p>At this instant a force of our cavalry, who had been following the train at some
              interval, charged suddenly upon the Secesh captors, who proceeded at once to make the
              best escape they could. Most of them got away, but we gobbled two officers and
              seventeen men, as it were in the very acts just described. The sight was one which
              admitted of little discussion, as may be imagined. The seventeen captured men and two
              officers were put under guard for the night, but it was decided there and then that
              they should die.</p>

            <p>The next morning the two officers were taken in the town, separate places, put in the
              centre of the street, and shot. The seventeen men were taken to an open ground, a
              little to one side. They were placed in a hollow square , encompass'd by two of our
              cavalry regiments, one of which regiments had three days before found the bloody
              corpses of three'of their men hamstrung and hung up by the heels to limbs of trees by
              Moseby's guerillas, and the other had not long before had twelve men, after
              surrendering, shot and then hung by the neck to limbs of trees, and jeering
              inscriptions pinn'd to the breast of one of the corpses, who had been a sergeant.
              Those three, and those twelve, had been found, I say, by these environing regiments.
              Now, with revolvers, they form'd the grim cordon of their seventeen prisoners. The
              latter were placed <pb facs="ppp.01876.0218.jpg" xml:id="leaf109v" n="36" type="verso"
              /> in the midst of the hollow square, were unfasten'd, and the ironical remark made to
              them that they were now to be given "a chance for themselves." A few ran for it. But
              what use ? From every side the deadly pills came. In a few minutes the seventeen
              corpses strew'd the hollow square.......I was curious to know whether some of the
              Union soldiers, some few, (some one or two at least of the youngsters,) did not
              abstain from shooting on the helpless men. Not one. There was no exultation, very
              little said ; almost nothing, yet every man there contributed his shot.</p>

            <p>(Multiply the above by scores, aye hundreds&#8212;yarify it in all the forms that
              different circumstances, individuals, places, &#38;c., could afford&#8212;light it

            <p><hi rend="italic">Gifts&#8212;Money&#8212;Discrimination</hi>.&#8212;As a very large
              proportion of the wounded still come up from the front without a cent of money in
              their pockets, I soon discover'd that it was about the best thing I could do to raise
              their spirits, and show them that somebody cared for them, and practically felt a
              fatherly or brotherly interest in them, to give them small sums, in such cases, using
              tact and discretion about it. I am regularly supplied with funds for this purpose by
              good women and men in Boston, Salem, Providence, Brooklyn, and New York. I provide
              myself with a quantity of bright, new ten-cent and five-cent bills, and, when I think
              it incumbent, I give 25 or 30 cents, or perhaps 50 cents, and occasionally a still
              larger sum to some particular case.</p>

            <p>As I have recurr'd to this subject several times, I may take opportunity to ventilate
              and sum up the financial question. My supplies, altogether voluntary, mostly
              confidential, often seeming quite Providential, were numerous and varied. For
              instance, there were two distant and wealthy ladies, sisters, who sent regularly, for
              two years, quite heavy sums, enjoining that their names should be kept secret. The
              same delicacy was indeed a frequent condition. From several I had <hi rend="italic"
                >carte blanche</hi>. Many were entire strangers. From these sources, during from two
              to three years, in the manner described, in the Hospitals, I bestow'd, as almoner for
              others, many, many thousands of dollars. I learn'd one thing conclusively&#8212;that
              beneath all the ostensible greed and heartlessness of our times there is no end to the
              generous benevolence of men and women in the United States, when once sure of their
              object. Another thing became clear to me&#8212;while <hi rend="italic">cash</hi> is
              not amiss to bring up the rear, tact and magnetic sympathy and unction are, and ever

              some soap and towels. I noticed afterward he was the cleanest of the whole
              Ward.......Mrs. G., lady, nurse, Ward F., wants a bottle of brandy&#8212;has two
              patients imperatively requiring stimulus&#8212;low with wounds and exhaustion. (I
              supplied her with a bottle of first-rate brandy, from the Christian Commission
              rooms.)</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">A Case from Second Bull Run</hi>.&#8212;Well, poor John Mahay is
              dead. He died yesterday. His was a painful and long lingering case, (see p. 10, <hi
                rend="italic">ante</hi>.) I have been with him at times for the past fifteen months.
              He belonged to Company A, One Hundred and First New York, and was shot through the
              lower region of the abdomen at second Bull Run, August, '62. One scene at his bedside
              will suffice for the agonies of nearly two years. The bladder had been perforated by a
              bullet going entirely through him. Not long since I sat a good part of the morning by
              his bedside, Ward E, Armory Square. The water ran out of his eyes from the intense
              pain, and the muscles of his face were distorted, but he utter'd nothing except a low
              groan now and then. Hot moist cloths were applied, and reliev'd him somewhat. Poor
              Mahay, a mere boy in age, but old in misfortune. He never knew the love of parents,
              was placed in his infancy in one of the New York charitable institutions, and
              subsequently bound out to a tyrannical master in Sullivan County, (the scars of whose
              cowhide and club remain 'd yet on his back.) His wound here was a most disagreeable
              one, for he was a gentle, cleanly and affectionate boy. He found friends in his
              hospital life, and, indeed, was a universal favorite. He had quite a funeral
              ceremony.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">Army Surgeons&#8212;Aid deficiencies</hi>.&#8212;I must bear my
              most emphatic testimony to the zeal, manliness, and professional spirit and capacity,
              generally prevailing among the Surgeons, many of them young men, in the Hospitals and
              the army. I will not say much about the exceptions, for they are few ; (but I have met
              some of those few, and very incompetent and airish they were.) I never ceas'd to find
              the best young men, and the hardest and most disinterested workers, among <pb
                facs="ppp.01876.0220.jpg" xml:id="leaf110v" n="38" type="verso"/> these Surgeons, in
              the Hospitals. They are full of genius, too. I have seen many hundreds of them, and
              this is my testimony.</p>

            <p>There are, however, serious deficiencies, wastes, sad want of system, &#38;c., in the
              Commissions, contributions, and in all the Voluntary, and a great part of the
              Governmental, nursing, edibles, medicines, stores, &#38;c. (I do not say surgical
              attendance, because the Surgeons cannot do more than human endurance permits.)
              Whatever puffing accounts there may be in the papers of the North, this is the actual
              fact. No thorough previous preparation, no system, no foresight, no genius. Always
              plenty of stores, no doubt, but always miles away ; never where they are needed, and
              never the proper application. Of all harrowing experiences, none is greater than that
              of the days following a heavy battle. Scores, hundreds of the noblest young men on
              earth, uncomplaining, lie, helpless, mangled, faint, alone, and so bleed to death, or
              die from exhaustion, either actually untouch'd at all, or merely the laying of them
              down and leaving them, when there ought to be means provided to save them.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">The Blue everywhere</hi>. This city, its suburbs, the Capitol, the
              front of the White House, the places of amusement, the Avenue, and all the main
              streets, swarm with soldiers this winter more than ever before. Some are out from the
              Hospitals, some from tha neighboring camps, &#38;c. One source or another, they pour
              in plenteously, and make, I should say, the mark'd feature in the human movement and
              costume-appearance of our National city. Their blue pants and overcoats are
              everywhere. The clump of crutches is heard, and up the stairs of the Paymasters'
              offices ; and there are characteristic groups around the doors of the same, often
              waiting long and wearily in the cold .......Toward the latter part of the afternoon
              you see the furlough'd men, sometimes singly, sometimes in small squads, making their
              way to the Baltimore depot. At all times, except early in the morning, the patrol
              detachments are moving around, especially during the earlier hours of evening,
              examining passes, and arresting all without them. They do not question the one-legged,
              or men badly disabled or maim'd, but all others are stopt. They also go around through
              the auditoriums of the theatres, and make officers and all show their passes, or other
              authority, for being there.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">Sunday, Jan</hi>. 29, 1865.&#8212;Have been in Armory Square this
              afternoon. The Wards are very comfortable, with new floors and plaster walls, and
              models of neatness. I'am not sure but this is a model hospital, after all, in
              important respects. I found several sad cases of old, lingering wounds. One Delaware
              soldier, Wm. H. Millis, from Bridgeville, whom I had been with after the battles of
              the Wilderness, last May, where he receiv'd a very bad wound in the chest, <pb
                facs="ppp.01876.0221.jpg" xml:id="leaf111r" n="39" type="recto"/> with another in
              the left arm, and whose case was serious (pneumonia had set in) all last June and
              July, I now find well enough to do light duty. For three weeks at the time mention'd,
              he just hover'd between life and death.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">Boys in the Army</hi>.&#8212;As I walk'd home about sunset, I saw
              in Fourteenth street a very young soldier, thinly clad, standing near the house I was
              about to enter. I stopt a moment in front of the door and call'd him to me. I knew
              that an old Tennessee Union regiment, and also an Indiana regiment, were temporarily
              stopping in new barracks, near Fourteenth street. This boy I found belonged to the
              Tennessee regiment. But I could hardly believe he carried a musket. He was but 15
              years old, yet had been twelve months a soldier, and had borne his part in several
              battles, even historic ones.......I ask'd him if he did not suffer from the cold and
              if he had no overcoat. No, he did not suffer from cold, and had no overcoat, but could
              draw one whenever he wish'd. His father was dead, and his mother living in some part
              of East Tennessee ; all the men were from that part of the country.</p>

            <p>The next forenoon I saw the Tennessee and Indiana regiments marching down the Avenue.
              My boy was with the former, stepping along with the rest. There were many other boys
              no older. I stood and watch'd them as they tramp'd along with slow, strong, heavy,
              regular steps. There did not appear to be a man over 30 years of age, and a large
              proportion were from 15 to perhaps 22 or 23. They had all the look of veterans, worn,
              stain'd, impassive, and a certain unbent, lounging gait, carrying in addition to their
              regular arms and knapsacks, frequently a frying-pan, broom, &#38;c. They were all of
              pleasant, even handsome physiognomy ; no refinement, nor blanch'd with intellect, but
              as my eye pick'd them, moving along, rank by rank, there did not seem to be a single
              repulsive, brutal or markedly stupid face among them.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">Burial of a Lady Nurse</hi>.&#8212;Here is an incident that has
              just occurr'd in one of the Hospitals. A lady named Miss or Mrs. Billings, who has
              long been a practical friend of soldiers and nurse in the army, and had become
              attach'd to it in a way that no one can realize but him or her who has had experience,
              was taken sick, early this winter, linger'd some time, and finally died in the
              Hospital. It was her request that she should be buried among the soldiers, and after
              the military method. This request was fully carried out. Her coffin was carried to the
              grave by soldiers, with the usual escort, buried, and a salute fired over the grave.
              This was at Annapolis a few days since.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">Female Nurses for Soldiers</hi>.&#8212;There are many women in one
              position or another, among the Hospitals, mostly as nurses here in Washington, and
              among the military stations ; <pb facs="ppp.01876.0222.jpg" xml:id="leaf111v" n="40"
                type="verso"/> quite a number of them young ladies acting as volunteers. They are a
              great help in certain ways, and deserve to be mention'd with praise and respect. Then
              it remains to be distinctly said that few or no young ladies, under the irresistible
              conventions of society, answer the practical requirements of nurses for soldiers.
              Middle-aged or healthy and good condition'd elderly women, mothers of children, are
              always best. Many of the wounded must be handled. A hundred things which cannot be
              gainsay'd, must occur and must be done. The presence of a good middle-aged or elderly
              woman, the magnetic touch of hands, the expressive features of the mother, the silent
              soothing of her presence, her words, her knowledge and privileges arrived at only
              through having had children, are precious and final qualifications. (Mrs. H. J.
              Wright, of Mansion House Hospital, Alexandria, is one of those good nurses. I have
              known her for over two years in her labors of love.) It is a natural faculty that is
              required ; it is not merely having a genteel young woman at a table in a Ward. One of
              the finest nurses I met was a redfaced illiterate old Irish woman ; I have seen her
              take the poor wasted naked boys so tenderly up in her arms. There are plenty of
              excellent clean old black women that would make tip-top nurses.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">Southern Escapees, Feb</hi>. 23, '65.&#8212;I saw a large
              procession of young men from the rebel army, (deserters they are call'd, but the usual
              meaning of the word does not apply to them,) passing along the Avenue to-day. There
              were nearly 200 of them, come up yesterday by boat from James River. I stood and
              watch'd them as they pass'd along in a slow, tired, worn sort of way. There was a
              curiously large proportion of light-hair'd, blonde, light gray-eyed young men among
              them. Their costumes had a dirt-stain'd uniformity ; most had been originally gray ;
              some among them had articles of our uniform, pants on one, vest or coat on another. I
              think they were mostly Georgia and North Carolina boys. They excited little or no
              attention. As I stood quite close to them, several good looking enough American
              youths, (but what a tale of misery their appearance told,) nodded or just spoke to me,
              without doubt divining pity and fatherliness out of my face, for my heart was full
              enough of it. Several of the couples trudged along with their arms about each other,
              some probably brothers ; it seem'd as if they were afraid they might some how get
              separated. They nearly all look'd what one might call simple, yet intelligent enough,
              too. Some had pieces of old carpet, some blankets, and others old bags around their
              shoulders, and some of them here and there had fine faces, still it was a procession
              of misery. The two hundred had with them about half a dozen arm'd guards.</p>

            <p>Along this week I saw some such procession, more or less <pb
                facs="ppp.01876.0223.jpg" xml:id="leaf112r" n="41" type="recto"/> in numbers, every
              day, as they were brought up by the boat. The Government does what it can for them,
              and sends them North and West.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">Feb</hi>. 27, '65.&#8212;Some three or four hundred more escapees
              from the Confederate army came up on the boat to-day. As the day has been very
              pleasant indeed, (after a long spell of bad weather,) I have been wandering around a
              good deal, without any other object than to be out-doors and enjoy it ; have met these
              escaped men in all directions. Their apparel is the same ragged, long-worn motley as
              before described. I talk'd with a number of the men. Some are quite bright and
              stylish, for all their poor clothes&#8212;walking with an air, wearing their old
              head-coverings on one side, quite saucily. (I find the old, unquestionable proofs, as
              all along, the past four years, of the unscrupulous tyranny exercised by the Secession
              government in conscripting the common people by absolute force everywhere, and paying
              no attention whatever to the men's time being up&#8212;keepping them in military
              service just the same.).......One gigantic young fellow, a Georgian, at least six feet
              three inches high, broad-sized in proportion, attired in the dirtiest, drab,
              wellsmear'd rags, tied with strings, his trousers at the knees all strips and
              streamers, was complacently standing eating some bread and meat. He appear'd contented
              enough. Then a few minutes after I saw him slowly walking along. It was plain he did
              not take anything to heart.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">Feb</hi>. 28.&#8212;As I pass'd the military headquarters of the
              city, not far from the President's house, I stopt to talk with some of the crowd of
              escapees who were lounging there. In appearance they were the same as previously
              mention'd. Two of them, one about 17, and the other perhaps 25 or 6, I talk'd with
              some time. They were from North Carolina, born and rais'd there, and had folks there.
              The elder had been in the rebel service four years. He was first conscripted for two
              years. He was then kept arbitrarily in the ranks. This is the case with a large
              proportion of the Secession army. There is no shame in leaving such service&#8212;was
              nothing downcast in these young men's manners. The younger had been soldiering about a
              year. He was conscripted. There were six brothers (all the boys of the family) in the
              army, part of them as conscripts, part as volunteers. Three had been kill'd. One had
              escaped about four months ago, and now this one had got away. He was a pleasant and
              well-talking lad, with the peculiar North Carolina idiom, (not at all disagreeable to
              my ears.) He and the elder one were of the same company, and escaped
              together&#8212;and wish'd to remain together. They thought of getting transportation
              away to Missouri, and working there ; but were not sure it was judicious. I advised
              them rather to go to some of the directly northern States, and get farm work for the
              present <pb facs="ppp.01876.0224.jpg" xml:id="leaf112v" n="42" type="verso"/> The
              younger had made six dollars on the boat, with some tobacco he brought ; he had three
              and a half left. The elder had nothing. I gave him a trifle.......Soon after, I met
              John Wormley, 9th Alabama&#8212;is a West Tennessee rais'd boy, parents both
              dead&#8212;had the look of one for a long time on short allowance&#8212;said very
              little&#8212;chew'd tobacco at a fearful rate, spitting in proportion&#8212;large
              clear dark-brown eyes, very fine&#8212;didn't know what to make of me&#8212;told me at
              last he wanted much to get some clean underclothes, and a pair of decent pants. Didn't
              care about coat or hat fixings. Wanted a chance to wash himself well, and put on the
              underclothes. I had the very great pleasure of helping him to accomplish all those
              wholesome designs.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">March</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">st</hi>.&#8212;Plenty more butternut
              or clay-color'd escapees every day. About 160 came in to-day, a large portion South
              Carolinians. They generally take the oath of allegiance, and are sent north, west, or
              extreme south-west if they wish. Several of them told me that the desertions in their
              army, of men going home, leave or no leave, are far more numerous than their
              desertions to our side. I saw a very forlorn looking squad of about a hundred, late
              this afternoon, on their way to the Baltimore depot.</p>

            <p>To-night I have been wandering awhile in the Capitol, which is all lit up. The
              illuminated Rotunda looks fine. I like to stand aside and look a long, long while, up
              at the dome ; it comforts me somehow. The House and Senate were both in session till
              very late. I look'd in upon them, but only a few moments ; they were hard at work on
              tax and appropriation bills. I wander'd through the long and rich corridors and
              apartments under the Senate ; an old habit of mine, former winters, and now more
              satisfaction than ever. Not many persons down there, occasionally a flitting figure in
              the distance.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">The Inauguration, March</hi> 4.&#8212;The President very quietly
              rode down to the Capitol in his own carriage, by himself, on a sharp trot, about noon,
              either because he wish'd to be on hand to sign bills, &#38;c., or to get rid of
              marching in line with the absurd procession, the muslin Temple of Liberty, and
              pasteboard Monitor. I saw him on his return, at three o'clock, after the performance
              was over. He was in his plain two-horse barouche, and look'd very much worn and tired
              ; the lines, indeed, of vast responsibilites, intricate questions, and demands of life
              and death, cut deeper than ever upon his dark brown face ; yet all the old goodness,
              tenderness, sadness, and canny shrewdness, underneath the furrows. (I never see that
              man without feeling that he is one to become personally attach'd to, for his
              combination of purest, heartiest tenderness, and native Western even rudest forms of
              manliness.) By his side sat his little boy, of ten years. There were no soldiers, only
              a lot of civilians on <pb facs="ppp.01876.0225.jpg" xml:id="leaf113r" n="43"
                type="recto"/> horseback, with huge yellow scarfs over their shoulders, riding
              around the carriage. (At the Inauguration four years ago, he rode down and back again,
              surrounded by a dense mass of arm'd cavalrymen eight deep, with drawn sabres ; and
              there were sharp-shooters station'd at every corner on the route.)</p>

            <p>I ought to make mention of the closing Levee of Saturday night last. Never before was
              such a compact jam in front of the White House&#8212;all the grounds fill'd, and away
              out to the spacious sidewalks.......I was there, as I took a notion to go&#8212;was in
              the rush inside with the crowd&#8212;surged along the passage-ways, the Blue and other
              rooms, and through the great East room, (upholster'd like a stage parlor.) Crowds of
              country people, some very funny. Fine music from the Marine Band, off in a side
              place.......I saw Mr. Lincoln, drest all in black, with white kid gloves, and a
              claw-hammer coat, receiving, as in duty bound, shaking hands, looking very
              disconsolate, and as if he would give anything to be somewhere else.</p>

                <corr>The Weather&#8212;Does it Sympathise with these Times?</corr>
              </choice>&#8212;Whether the rains, the heat and cold, and what underlies them all, are
              affected with what affects man in masses, and follow his play of passionate action,
              strain'd stronger than usual, and on a larger scale than usual&#8212;whether this, or
              no, it is certain that there is now, and has been for twenty months or more on this
              American Continent North, many a remarkable, many an unprecedented expression of the
              subtile world of air above us and around us. There, since this War, and the wide and
              deep National agitation, strange analogies, different combinations, a different
              sunlight, or absence of it ; different products even out of the ground. After every
              great battle, a great storm. Even civic events, the same. On Saturday last, a forenoon
              like whirling demons, dark, with slanting rain, full of rage ; and then the afternoon,
              so calm, so bathed with flooding splendor from heaven's most excellent sun, with
              atmosphere of sweetness ; so clear, it show'd the stars, long, lonor before they were
              due. As the President came out on the Capitol portico, a curious little white cloud,
              the only one in that part of the sky, appear 'd like a hovering bird, right over
              him.</p>

            <p>Indeed, the heavens, the elements, all the meteorological influences, have run riot
              for weeks past. Such caprices, abruptest alternation of frowns and beauty, I never
              knew. It is a common remark that (as last Summer was different in its spells of
              intense heat from any preceding it,) the Winter just completed has been without
              parallel. It has remain'd so down to the hour I am writing. Much of the daytime of the
              past mouth was sulky, with leaden heaviness, fog, interstices of bitter cold, and'some
              insane storms. But there have been samples of another description. Nor earth, <pb
                facs="ppp.01876.0226.jpg" xml:id="leaf113v" n="44" type="verso"/> nor sky ever knew
              spectacles of superber beauty than some of the nights have lately been here. The
              western star, Venus, in the earlier hours of evening, has never been so large, so
              clear ; it seems as if it told something, as if it held rapport indulgent with
              humanity, with us Americans. Five or six nights since, it hung close by the moon, then
              a little past its first quarter. The star was wonderful, the moon like a young mother.
              The sky, dark blue, the transparent night, the planets, the moderate west wind, the
              elastic temperature, the unsurpassable miracle of that great star, and the young and
              swelling moon swimming in the west, suffused the soul. Then I heard, slow and clear,
              the deliberate notes of a bugle come up out of the silence, sounding so good through
              the night's mystery, no hurry, but firm and faithful, floating along, rising, falling
              leisurely, with here and there a long-drawn note ; the bugle, well play'd, sounding
              tattoo, in one of the army Hospitals near here, where the wounded (some of them
              personally so dear to me,) are lying in their cots, and many a sick boy come down to
              the war from Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, and the rest.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">March</hi> 6&#8212;<hi rend="italic">Inauguration
              Ball</hi>.&#8212;I have this moment been up to look at the gorgeous array'd dance and
              supper-rooms, for the Inauguration Ball, at the Patent Office, (which begins in a few
              hours ;) and I could not help thinking of those rooms, where the music will sound and
              the dancers' feet presently tread&#8212;what a different scene they presented to my
              view a while since, fill'd with a crowded mass of the worst wounded of the war,
              brought in from Second Bull Run, Antietam and Fredericksburgh. To-night, beautiful
              women, perfumes, the violins' sweetness, the polka and the waltz ; but then, the
              amputation, the blue face, the groan, the glassy eye of the dying, the clotted rag,
              the odor of wounds and blood, and many a mother's son amid strangers, passing away
              untended there, (for the crowd of the badly hurt was great, and much for nurse to do,
              and much for surgeon.)</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">Scene at the Capitol</hi>&#8212;I must mention a strange scene at
              the Capitol, the Hall of Representatives, the morning of Saturday last, (March 4th.)
              The day just dawn'd, but in half-darkness, everything dim, leaden, and soaking. In
              that dim light the members nervous from long drawn duty, exhausted, some asleep, and
              many half asleep. The gas-light, mix'd with the dingy day-break, produced an unearthly
              effect. The poor little sleepy, stumbling pages, the smell of the Hall, the members
              with heads leaning on their desks asleep, the sounds of the voices speaking, with
              unusual intonations&#8212;the general moral atmosphere also of the close of this
              important session&#8212;the strong hope that the War is approaching its
              close&#8212;the tantalizing dread lest the hope may be a false one&#8212;the grandeur
              of the Hall itself, with its effect of vast shadows up toward the panels and spaces
              over the galleries&#8212;all made a mark'd combination.</p>

            <pb facs="ppp.01876.0227.jpg" xml:id="leaf114r" n="45" type="recto"/>

            <p>In the midst of this, with the suddenness of a thunderbolt, burst one of the most
              angry and crashing storms of rain and wind ever heard. It beat like a deluge on the
              heavy glass roof of the Hall, and the wind literally howl'd and roar'd. For a moment,
              (and no wonder,) the nervous and sleeping Representatives were thrown into confusion.
              The slumberers awaked with fear, some started for the doors, some look'd up with
              blanch'd cheeks and lips to the roof, and the little pages began to cry ; it was a
              scene ! But it was over almost as soon as the drowsied men were actually awake. They
              recover'd themselves ; the storm raged on, beating, dashing, and with loud noises at
              times. But the House went ahead with its business then, I think, as calmly and with as
              much deliberation as at any time in its career. Perhaps the shock did it good. (One is
              not without impression, after all, amid these members of Congress, of both the Houses,
              that if the flat and selfish routine of their duties should ever be broken in upon by
              some great emergency involving real danger, and calling for first-class personal
              qualities, those qualities would be found generally forthcoming, and from men not now
              credited with them.)</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">March</hi> 27, 1865&#8212;<hi rend="italic">A Yankee
              Antique</hi>.&#8212;Sergeant Calvin F. Harlowe, Co. C, Twenty-Ninth Massachusetts,
              Third Brigade, Pirst Division, Ninth Corps&#8212;a mark'd sample of heroism and death,
              (some may say bravado, but I say <hi rend="italic">heroism</hi>, of grandest, oldest
              order)&#8212;in the late attack by the rebel troops, and temporary capture by them, of
              Fort Steadman, at night. The Fort was surprised at dead of night. Suddenly awaken'd
              from their sleep, and rushing from their tents, Harlowe, with others, found himself in
              the hands of the Secesh&#8212;they demanded his surrender&#8212;he answer'd, <hi
                rend="italic">Never while I live</hi>. (Of course it was useless. The others
              surrender'd ; the odds were too great.) Again he was ask'd to yield, this time by a
              rebel Captain. Though surrounded, and quite calm, he again refused, call'd sternly to
              his comrades to fight on, and himself attempted to do so. The rebel Captain then shot
              him&#8212;but at the same instant he shot the Captain. Both fell together, mortally
              wounded. Harlowe died almost instantly. (The rebels were driven out in a very short
              time.) The body was buried next day, but soon taken up and sent home, (Plymouth Co.,
              Mass.).......Harlowe was only 22 years of age&#8212;was a tall, slim, dark-hair'd,
              blueeyed young man&#8212;had come out originally with the Twenty-Ninth Mass., and that
              is the way he met his death, after four years campaign. He was in the Seven Days Fight
              before Richmond, in Second Bull Run, Antietam, First Fredericksburgh, Vicksburgh,
              Jackson, Wilderness, and the campaigns following&#8212;was as good a soldier as ever
              wore the blue, and every old officer of the regiment will bear that
              testimony........Though so young, and in a common rank, he had a spirit as resolute
              and brave as any hero in the books, ancient or <pb facs="ppp.01876.0228.jpg"
                xml:id="leaf114v" n="46" type="verso"/> modern&#8212;It was too great to say the
              words "I surrender"&#8212;and so he died.......("When I think of such things, knowing
              them well, all the vast and complicated events of the War on which History dwells and
              makes its volumes, fall indeed aside, and for the moment at any rate I see nothing but
              young Calvin Harlowe's figure in the night disdaining to surrender.)</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">Wounds and Diseases</hi>.&#8212;The war is over, but the hospitals
              are fuller than ever, from former and current cases. A large majority of the wounds
              are in the arms and legs. But there is every kind of wound, in every part of the body.
              I should say of the sick, from my observation, that the prevailing maladies are
              typhoid fever and the camp fevers gene rally, diarrhoea, catarrhal affections and
              bronchitis, rheumatism and pneumonia. These forms of sickness lead; all the rest
              follow. There are twice as many sick as there are wounded. The deaths range from 7 to
              10 per cent. of those under treatment.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">Murder of President Lincoln</hi>.&#8212;The day, April 14, 1865,
              seems to have been a pleasant one throughout the whole land&#8212;the moral atmosphere
              pleasant too&#8212;the long storm, so dark, so fratricidal, full of blood and doubt
              and gloom, over and ended at last by the sun-rise of such an absolute National
              victory, and utter breaking-down of Secessionism&#8212; we almost doubted our own
              senses ! Lee had capitulated beneath the apple-tree of Appomattax. The other armies,
              the flanges of the revolt, swiftly follow'd.......And could it really be, then ? Out
              of all the affairs of this world of woe and passion, of failure and disorder and
              dismay, was there really come the confirm'd, unerring sign of plan, like a shaft of
              pure light&#8212;of rightful rule&#8212;of God ?.......So the day, as I say, was
              propitious. Early herbage, early flowers, were out. (I remember where I was stopping
              at the time, the season being advanced, there were many lilacs in full bloom. By one
              of those caprices that enter and give tinge to events without being at all a part of
              them, I find myself always reminded of the great tragedy of that day by the sight and
              odor of these blossoms. It never fails.)</p>

            <p>But I must not dwell on accessories. The deed hastens. The popular afternoon paper of
              Washington, the little <hi rend="italic">Evening Star</hi>, had spatter'd all over its
              third page, divided among the advertisements in a sensational manner in a hundred
              different places, <hi rend="italic">The President and his Lady will be at the Theatre
                this evening</hi>.......(Lincoln was fond of the theatre. I have myself seen him
              there several times. I remember thinking how funny it was that He, in some respects,
              the leading actor in the greatest and stormiest drama known to real history's stage,
              through centuries, should sit there and be so completely interested and absorb'd in
              those human jack-straws, moving about with their silly little gestures, foreign
              spirit, and flatulent text.)</p>

            <pb facs="ppp.01876.0229.jpg" xml:id="leaf115r" n="47" type="recto"/>

            <p>On this occasion the theatre was crowded, many ladies in rich and gay costumes,
              officers in their uniforms, many well known citizens, young folks, the usual clusters
              of gaslights, the usual magnetism of so many people, cheerful, with perfumes, music of
              violins and flutes&#8212;(and over all, and saturating all, that vast vague wonder,
                <hi rend="italic">Victory</hi>, the Nation's Victory, the triumph of the Union,
              filling the air, the thought, the sense, with exhilaration more than all
              perfumes.)</p>

            <p>The President came betimes, and, with his wife, witness'd the play, from the large
              stage-boxes of the second tier, two thrown into one, and profusely draped with the
              National flag. The acts and scenes of the piece&#8212;one of those singularly written
              compositions which have at least the merit of giving entire relief to an audience
              engaged in mental action or business excitements and cares during the day, as it makes
              not the slightest call on either the moral, emotional, esthetic, or spiritual
              nature&#8212;a piece, ('Our American Cousin,') in which, among other characters, so
              call'd, a Yankee, certainly such a one as was never seen, or the least like it ever
              seen, in North America, is introduced in England, with a varied fol-de-rol of talk,
              plot, scenery, and such phantasmagoria as goes to make up a modern popular
              drama&#8212;had progress'd through perhaps a couple of its acts, when in the midst of
              this comedy, or tragedy, or non-such, or whatever it is to be call'd, and to off-set
              it or finish it out, as if in Nature's and the Great Muse's mockery of those poor
              mimes, comes interpolated that Scene, not really or exactly to be described at all,
              (for on the many hundreds who were there it seems to this hour to have left little but
              a passing blur, a dream, a blotch)&#8212;and yet partially to be described as I now
              proceed to give it.......There is a scene in the play representing a modern parlor, in
              which two unprecedented English ladies are inform'd by the unprecedented and
              impossible Yankee that he is not a man of fortune, and therefore undesirable for
              marriage-catching purposes ; after which, the comments being finish'd, the dramatic
              trio make exit, leaving the stage clear for a moment. There was a pause, a hush as it
              were. At this period came the murder of Abraham Lincoln. Great as that was, with all
              its manifold train, circling round it, and stretching into the future for many a
              century, in the politics, history, art, &#38;c., of the New World, in point of fact
              the main thing, the actual murder, transpired with the quiet and simplicity of any
              commonest occurrence&#8212;the bursting of a bud or pod in the growth of vegetation,
              for instance. Through the general hum following the stage pause, with the change of
              positions, &#38;c., came the muffled sound of a pistol shot, which not one hundredth
              part of the audience heard at the time&#8212;and yet a moment's hush&#8212; somehow,
              surely a vague startled thrill&#8212;and then, through <pb facs="ppp.01876.0230.jpg"
                xml:id="leaf115v" n="48" type="verso"/> the ornamented, draperied, starr'd and
              striped space-way of the President's box, a sudden figure, a man raises himself with
              hands and feet, stands a moment on the railing, leaps below to the stage, (a distance
              of perhaps fourteen or fifteen feet,) falls out of position, catching his boot-heel in
              the copious drapery, (the American flag,) falls on one knee, quickly recovers himself,
              rises as if nothing had happen 'd, (he really sprains his ankle, but unfelt
              then,)&#8212;and so the figure, Booth, the murderer, dress'd in plain black
              broadcloth, bare-headed, with a full head of glossy, raven hair, and his eyes like
              some mad animal's flashing with light and resolution, yet with a certain strange
              calmness, holds aloft in one hand a large knife&#8212;walks along not much back from
              the footlights&#8212;turns fully toward the audience his face of statuesque beauty,
              lit by those basilisk eyes, flashing with desperation, perhaps insanity&#8212;launches
              out in a firm and steady voice the words, <hi rend="italic">Sic semper
              tyrannis</hi>&#8212;and then walks with neither slow nor very rapid pace diagonally
              across to the back of the stage, and disappears.......(Had not all this terrible
              scene&#8212;making the mimic ones preposterous&#8212;had it not all been rehears'd, in
              blank, by Booth, beforehand ?)</p>

            <p>A moment's hush, incredulous&#8212;a scream&#8212;the cry of <hi rend="italic"
                >Murder</hi>&#8212;Mrs. Lincoln leaning out of the box, with ashy cheeks and lips,
              with involuntary cry, pointing to the retreating figure, <hi rend="italic">He has
                kill'd the President</hi>.......And still a moment's strange, incredulous
              suspense&#8212;and then the deluge !&#8212;then that mixture of horror, noises,
              uncertainty&#8212;(the sound, somewhere back, of a horse's hoofs clattering with
              speed)&#8212;the people burst through chairs and railings, and break them
              up&#8212;that noise adds to the queerness of the scene&#8212;there is inextricable
              confusion and terror&#8212;women faint&#8212;quite feeble persons fall, and are
              trampled on&#8212;many cries of agony are heard&#8212;the broad stage suddenly fills
              to suffocation with a dense and motley crowd, like some horrible carnival&#8212;the
              audience rush generally upon it&#8212;at least the strong men do&#8212;the actors and
              actresses are all there in their play-costumes and painted faces, with mortal fright
              showing through the rouge, some trembling&#8212;some in tears&#8212;the screams and
              calls, confused talk&#8212;redoubled, trebled&#8212;two or three manage to pass up
              water from the stage to the President's box&#8212;others try to clamber
              up&#8212;&#38;c., &#38;c., &#38;c.</p>

            <p>In the" midst of all this, the soldiers of the President's Guard, with others,
              suddenly drawn to the scene, burst in&#8212;(some two hundred altogether)&#8212;they
              storm the house, through all the tiers, especially the upper ones, inflamed with fury,
              literally charging the audience with fix'd bayonets, muskets and pistols, shouting <hi
                rend="italic">Clear out! clear out I you sons of</hi>&#8212;.......Such the wild
              scene, or a suggestion of it rather, inside the play-house that night.</p>

            <p>Outside, too, in the atmosphere of shock and craze, crowds <pb
                facs="ppp.01876.0231.jpg" xml:id="leaf116r" n="49" type="recto"/> of people, fill'd
              with frenzy, ready to seize any outlet for it, come near committing murder several
              times on innocent individuals. One such case was especially exciting. The infuriated
              crowd, through some chance, got started against one man, either for words he utter'd,
              or perhaps without any cause at all, and were proceeding at once to actually hang him
              on a neighboring lamp post, when he was rescued by a few heroic policemen, who placed
              him in their midst and fought their way slowly and amid great peril toward the Station
              House.......It was a fitting episode of the whole affair. The crowd rushing and
              eddying to and fro&#8212;the night, the yells, the pale faces, many frighten'd people
              trying in vain to extricate themselves&#8212;the attack'd man, not yet freed from the
              jaws of death, looking like a corpse&#8212;the silent resolute half-dozen policemen,
              with no weapons but their little clubs, yet stern 'and steady through all those
              eddying swarms&#8212;made indeed a fitting side-scene to the grand tragedy of the
              murder.......They gain'd the Station House with the protected man, whom they placed in
              security for the night, and discharged him in the morning.</p>

            <p>And in the midst of that night-pandemonium of senseless hate, infuriated soldiers,
              the audience and the crowd&#8212;the stage, and all its actors and actresses, its
              paint-pots, spangles, and gas-lights&#8212;the life-blood from those veins, the best
              and sweetest of the land, drips slowly down, and death's ooze already begins its
              little bubbles on the lips.......Such, hurriedly sketch'd, were the accompaniments of
              the death of President Lincoln. So suddenly and in murder and horror unsurpass'd he
              was taken from us. But his death was painless.</p>

            <p>[He leaves for America's History and Biography, so far, not only its most dramatic
              reminiscence&#8212;he leaves, in my opinion, the greatest, best, most characteristic,
              artistic, Personality. Not but that he had faults, and show'd them in the Presidency ;
              but honesty, goodness, shrewdness, conscience, and (a new virtue, unknown to other
              lands, and hardly yet really known here, but the foundation and tie of all, as the
              future will grandly develop,) Unionism, in its truest and amplest sense, form'd the
              hard-pan of his character. These he seal'd with his life. The tragic splendor of his
              death, purging, illuminating all, throws round his form, his head, an aureole that
              will remain and will grow brighter through time, while History lives, and love of
              Country lasts. By many has <hi rend="italic">this Union</hi> been conserv'd and help'd
              ; but if one name, one man, must be pick'd out, he, most of all, is the Conservator of
              it, to the future. He was assassinated&#8212;but the Union is not
                assassinated&#8212;<hi rend="italic">&#231;a ira</hi>! One falls, and another falls.

                Pennsylvania&#8212;Died May</hi> 1 , '65<hi rend="italic">&#8212;My letter to his
                mother</hi>.&#8212;Dear Madam : No doubt you and Frank's friends have heard the sad
              fact of his death in Hospital here, through his uncle, or the lady from Baltimore, who
              took his things. (I have not seen them, only heard of them visiting Frank.) I will
              write you a few lines as a casual friend that sat by his death bed.</p>

            <p>Your son, Corporal Frank H. Irwin, was wounded near Fort Fisher, Virginia, March
              25th, 1865&#8212;the wound was in the left knee, pretty bad. He was sent up to
              Washington, was receiv'd in Ward C, Armory Square Hospital, March 28th&#8212;the wound
              became worse, and on the 4th of April the leg was amputated a little above the
              knee&#8212;the operation was perform 'd by Dr. Bliss, one of the best surgeons in the
              army&#8212;he did the whole operation himself&#8212;there was a good deal of bad
              matter gather'd&#8212;the bullet was found in the knee. For a couple of weeks
              afterwards he was doing pretty well. I visited and sat by him frequently, as he was
              fond of having me. The last ten or twelve days of April I saw that his case was
              critical. He previously had some fever, with cold spells. The last week in April he
              was much of the time flighty&#8212;but always mild and gentle. He died first <pb
                facs="ppp.01876.0233.jpg" xml:id="leaf117r" n="51" type="recto"/> of May. The actual
              cause of death was Pyaemia, (the absorption of the matter in the system instead of its
              discharge.)</p>

            <p>Frank, as far as I saw, had everything requisite in surgical treatment, nursing,
              &#38;c. He had watches much of the time. He was so good and well-behaved, and
              affectionate, I myself liked him very much. I was in the habit of coming in afternoons
              and sitting by him, and soothing him, and he liked to have me&#8212;liked to put his
              arm out and lay his hand on my knee&#8212;would keep it so a long while. Toward the
              last he was more restless and flighty at night&#8212;often fancied himself with his
              regiment&#8212;by his talk sometimes seem'd as if his feelings were hurt by being
              blamed by his officers for something he was entirely innocent of&#8212;said, "I never
              in my life was thought capable of such a thing, and never was." At other times he
              would fancy himself talking as it seem'd to children or such like, his relatives I
              suppose, and giving them good advice ; would talk to them along while. All the time he
              was out of his head not one single bad word or thought or idea escaped him. It was
              remark'd that many a man's conversation in his senses was not half as good as Frank's
              delirium.</p>

            <p>He was perfectly willing to die&#8212;he had become very weak and had suffer'd a good
              deal, and was perfectly resign'd, poor boy. I do not know his past life, but I feel as
              if it must have been good. At any rate what I saw of him here, under the most trying
              circumstances, with a painful wound, and among strangers, I can say that he behaved so
              brave, so composed, and so sweet and affectionate, it could not be surpass'd. And now
              like many other noble and good men, after serving his country as a soldier, he has
              yielded up his young life at the very outset in her service. Such things are
              gloomy&#8212;yet there is a text, "God doeth all things well,"&#8212;the meaning of
              which, after due time, appears to the soul.</p>

            <p>I thought perhaps a few words, though from a stranger, about your son, from one who
              was with him at the last, might be worth while, for I loyed the young man, though I
              but saw him immediately to lose him. I am merely a friend visiting the Hospitals
              occasionally to cheer the wounded and sick. W.W.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">May</hi> 7&#8212;(<hi rend="italic">Sunday</hi>.)&#8212;To-day as I
              was walking a mile or two south of Alexandria, I fell in with several large squads of
              the returning Western Army, (<hi rend="italic">Sherman's men</hi> as they call'd
              themselves) about a thousand in all, the largest portion of them half sick, some
              convalescents, &#38;c. These fragmentary excerpts, with the unmistakable western
              physiognomy and idioms, crawling along slowly&#8212;after a great campaign, blown this
              way, as it were, out of their latitude&#8212;I mark'd with curiosity, and talk'd with
              off and on for over an hour. Here and there was one very sick ; but all were able to
              walk, except some of the last, who had given out, and were seated <pb
                facs="ppp.01876.0234.jpg" xml:id="leaf117v" n="52" type="verso"/> on the ground,
              faint and despondent. These I tried to cheer, told them the camp they were to reach,
              (a sort of half-hospital,) was only a little way further over the hill, and so got
              them up and started on, accompanying some of the worst a little way, and helping them,
              or putting them under the support of stronger comrades.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">May</hi> 21.&#8212;Saw General Sheridan and his Cavalry to-day. It
              was a strong, attractive, serious sight. We have been having rainy weather. The men
              were mostly young, (a few middle-aged,) superb-looking fellows, brown, spare, keen,
              with well-worn clothing, many with pieces of water-proof cloth around their shoulders
              and hanging down. They dash'd along pretty fast, in wide close ranks, all spatter'd
              with mud ; no holiday soldiers. Quite all Americans (The Americans are the handsomest
              race that ever trod the earth.) They came clattering along, brigade after brigade. I
              could have watch'd for a week. Sheridan stood on a balcony, under a big tree, coolly
              smoking a cigar. His looks and manner impress'd me favorably.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">May</hi> 22.&#8212;Have been taking a walk along Pennsylvania
              Avenue and Seventh street north. The city is full of soldiers, running around loose.
              Officers everywhere, of all grades. All have the weather-beaten look of practical
              service. It is a sight I never tire of. All the Armies are nowhere (or portions of
              them,) for to-morrow's Review. You see them swarming like bees everywhere.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">The Grand Review</hi>.&#8212;For two days now the broad spaces of
              Pennsylvania Avenue along to Treasury Hill, and so by detour around to the President's
              House, (and so up to George town, and across the Aqueduct bridge,) have been alive
              with a magnificent sight, the returning Armies. In their wide ranks stretching clear
              across the Avenue I watch them march or ride along, at a brisk pace, through two whole
              days&#8212;Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery&#8212;some 200,000 men.........Some days
              afterwards one or two other Corps.......and then, still afterwards, a good part of
              Sherman's immense Army, brought up from Charleston, Savannah, &#38;c.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">Western Soldiers&#8212;May</hi> 26-7.&#8212;The streets, the public
              buildings and grounds of Washington still swarm with soldiers from Illinois, Indiana,
              Ohio, Missouri, Iowa, and all the Western States. I am continually meeting and talking
              with them. They often speak to me first, and always show great sociability, and glad
              to have a good interchange of chat.......These Western soldiers are more slow in their
              movements, and in their intellectual quality also ; have no extreme alertness. They
              are larger in size, have a more serious physiognomy, are continually looking at you as
              they pass in the street. They are largely animal, and handsomely so. (During the War I
              have been at times with the Fourteenth, Fifteenth, Seventeenth, and Twentieth Corps.)
              I <pb facs="ppp.01876.0235.jpg" xml:id="leaf118r" n="53" type="recto"/> always feel
              drawn toward the men, and like their personal contact when we are crowded close
              together, as frequently these days in the street-cars. They all think the world of
              General Sherman; call him "Old Bill," or sometimes "Uncle Billy."</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">May</hi> 28.&#8212;As I sat hy the bedside of a sick Michigan
              soldier in a Hospital to-day, a convalescent from the adjoining bed rose and came to
              me, and presently we began talking. He was a middle-aged man, belonged to the 2d
              Virginia regiment, but lived in Racine, Ohio, and had a family there. He spoke of
              President Lincoln, and said : " The war is over, and many are lost. And now we have
              lost the best, the fairest, the truest man in America. Take him altogether he was the
              best man this country ever produced. It was quite a while I thought very different ;
              but some time before the murder, that's the way I have seen it.".......There was deep
              earnestness in the soldier. (I found upon further talk he had known Mr. Lincoln
              personally, and quite closely, years before.) He was a veteran ; was now in the fifth
              year of his service ; was a cavalry man, and had been in a good deal of hard
              fighting.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">Two Brothers, one South, one North&#8212;May</hi> 28-9.&#8212;I

              about 19 years, W. S. P., (2nd Md. Southern,) very feeble, right leg amputated, can't
              sleep hardly at all&#8212;has taken a great deal of morphine, which, as usual, is
              costing more than it comes to. Evidently very intelligent and well bred&#8212;very
              affectionate&#8212;held on to my hand, and put it by his face, not willing to let me
              leave. As I was lingering, soothing him in his pain, he says to me suddenly, "I hardly
              think you know who I am&#8212;I don't wish to impose upon you&#8212;I am a rebel
              soldier." I said I did not know that, but it made no difference.......Visiting him
              daily for about two weeks after that, while he lived, (death had mark'd him, and he
              was quite alone,) I loved him much, always kiss'd him, and he did me.</p>

            <p>In an adjoining Ward I found his brother, an officer of rank, a Union soldier, a
              brave and religious man, (Col. Clifton K. Prentiss, Sixth Md. Infantry, Sixth Corps,
              wounded in one of the engagements at Petersburgh, April 2&#8212;linger'd, suffer'd
              much, died in Brooklyn, Aug. 20, '65.) It was in the same battle both were hit. One
              was a strong Unionist, the other Secesh ; both fought on their respective sides, both
              badly wounded, and both brought together here after absence of four years. Each died

            <p><hi rend="italic">June</hi> 9-10.&#8212;I have been sitting late to-night by the
              bedside of a wounded Captain, a friend of mine, lying with a painful fracture of left
              leg in one of the Hospitals, in a large Ward partially vacant. The lights were put
              out, all but a little candle, far from where I sat. The full moon shone in through the
              windows, making long, slanting silvery patches on the floor. All was still, my friend
              too was silent, but could not sleep ; so I sat there by him, slowly wafting the fan,
              and occupied with the musings that arose out of the scene, the long shadowy Ward, the
              beautiful ghostly moon light on the floor, the white beds, here and there an occupant
              with huddled form, the bed-clothes thrown off.</p>

            <p>The Hospitals have a number of cases of sun-stroke and exhaustion by heat, from the
              late Reviews. There are many such from the Sixth Corps, from the hot parade of day
              before yesterday. (Some of these shows cost the lives of scores of men.)</p>

              They are quite full. Many of the cases are bad ones, lingering wounds, and old cases
              of sickness. There is a more than usual look of despair on the countenances of many of
              the men ; hope has left them.......I went through the Wards talking as usual. There
              are several here from the Confederate army, whom I had seen in other Hospitals, and
              they recognized me. Two were in a dying condition.</p>

              spent in active service in the War in all parts of the country.) The two were chatting
              of one thing and another. The fever soldier spoke of John C. Calhoun's monument, which
              he had seen, and was describing it. The veteran said : "<hi rend="italic">I</hi> have
              seen Calhoun's monument. <hi rend="italic">That</hi> you saw is not the real monument.
              But I have seen it. It is the desolated, ruined South; nearly the whole generation of

              remaining. I went to the largest of these (Douglas) and spent the afternoon and
              evening. There are many sad cases, some old wounds, some of incurable sickness, and
              some of the wounded from the March and April battles before Richmond........(Few
              realize how sharp and bloody those closing battles were. Our men exposed themselves
              more than usual ; press'd ahead, without urging. Then the Southerners fought with
              extra desperation. Both sides knew that with the successful chasing of the rebel cabal
              from Richmond, and the occupation of that city by the National troops, the game was
              up. The dead and wounded were unusually many.......Of the wounded, both our own and
              the rebel, the last lingering driblets have been brought to Hospital here. I find many
              rebel wounded here, and have been extra busy to-day 'tending to the worst cases of
              them with the rest.)</p>

              the woods, pleasant and recluse, some two and a half or three miles north of the
              Capitol. The situation is healthy, with broken ground, grassy slopes and patches of
              oak woods, the trees large and fine. It was one of the most extensive of the
              Hospitals&#8212;but now reduced to four or five partially occupied Wards, the numerous
              others being entirely vacant. The patients are the leavings of the other Hospitals ;
              many of them very sad cases indeed. In November, this became the last Military
              Hospital kept up by the Government, all the others being closed. Cases of the worst
              and most incurable wounds, and obstinate illness, and of poor fellows who have no
              homes to go to, are found here.</p>

              part of the day at Harewood. As I write this, it is about an hour before sundown. I
              have walk'd out for a few minutes to the edge of the woods to soothe myself with the
              hour and scene. It is a glorious, warm, golden-sunny, still afternoon. The only noise
              here is from a crowd of cawing crows, on some trees three hundred yards distant.
              Clusters of gnats swimming and dancing in the air in all directions. The oak leaves
              are thick under the bare trees, and give a strong and delicious perfume.......Inside
              the Wards every thing is gloomy. Death is there. As I enter'd, I was confronted 'by
              it, the first thing. A corpse of a poor soldier, just dead, of typhoid fever. The
              attendants had just straighten'd the limbs, put coppers on the eyes, and were laying
              it out.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">Three Years Summ'd Up</hi>.&#8212;During my past three years in
              Hospital, camp or field, I made over 600 visits or tours, and <pb
                facs="ppp.01876.0238.jpg" xml:id="leaf119v" n="56" type="verso"/> went, as I
              estimate, among from 80,000 to 100,000 of the wounded and sick, as sustainer of spirit
              and body in some degree, in time of need. These visits varied from an hour or two, to
              all day or night ; for with dear or critical cases I always watch'd all night.
              Sometimes I took up my quarters in the Hospital, and slept or watch'd there several
              nights in succession. Those three years I consider the greatest privilege and
              satisfaction, (with all their feverish excitements and physical deprivations and
              lamentable sights,) and, of course, the most profound lesson and reminiscence, of my
              life. I can say that in my ministerings I comprehended all, whoever came in my way,
              Northern or Southern, and slighted none. It afforded me, too, the perusal of those
              subtlest, rarest, divinest volumes of Humanity, laid bare in its inmost recesses, and
              of actual life and death, better than the finest, most labor'd narratives, histories,
              poems in the libraries. It arous'd and brought out and decided undream'd-of depths of
              emotion. It has given me my plainest and most fervent views of the true <hi
                rend="italic">ensemble</hi> and extent of The States. While I was with wounded and
              sick in thousands of cases from the New England States, and from New York, New Jersey,
              and Pennsylvania, and from Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and all the
              Western States, I was with more or less from all the States, North and South, without
              exception. I was with many from the Border States, especially from Maryland and
              Virginia, and found, during those lurid years 1862-65, far more Union Southerners,
              especially Tennesseans, than is supposed. I was with many rebel officers and men among
              our wounded, and gave them always what I had, and tried to cheer them the same as any.
              I was among the army teamsters considerably, and, indeed, always found myself drawn to
              them. Among the black soldiers, wounded or sick, and in the contraband camps, I also
              took my way whenever in their neighborhood; and did what I could for them.</p>

              graves. (<hi rend="italic">They</hi> make indeed the true Memoranda of the

              noiseless miracles of soil and sun and running streams&#8212;how peaceful and how
              beautiful appear to-day even the Battle-Trenches, and the many hundred thousand
              Cemetery mounds ! Even at Andersonville, to-day, innocence and a smile. (A late
              account says, 'The stockade has fallen to decay, is grown upon, and a season more will
              efface it entirely, except from our hearts and memories. The <hi rend="italic">dead

              the old marks the last ten years have obliterated. The thirty-five wells, which the
              prisoners dug with cups and spoons, remain just as they were left. And the wonderful
              spring which was discover'd one morning, after a thunder storm, flowing down the
              hillside, still yields its sweet, pure water as freely now as then. The Cemetery, with
              its thirteen thousand graves, is on the slope of a beautiful hill. Over the quiet spot
              already trees give the cool shade which would have been so gratefully sought by the

              immediately after the tiring on <hi rend="italic">the Flag</hi> at Fort
              Sumter&#8212;the Nation ('till then incredulous) flush'd in the face, and all its
              veins fiercely pulsing and pounding&#8212;the arm'd volunteers instantaneously
              springing up everywhere&#8212;the tumultuous processions of the regiments&#8212;Was it
              not grand to have lived in such scenes and days, and be absorb'd by them, and
              unloosen'd to them?</p>

            <p>The news of the attack on Sumter was receiv'd in New York city late at night, (13th
              April, 1861,) and was immediately sent out in extras of the newspapers. I had been to
              the opera in Fourteenth street that night, and after the performance, was walking down
              Broadway toward twelve o'clock, on my way to Brooklyn, when I heard in the distance
              the loud cries of the newsboys, who came presently tearing and yelling up the street,
              rushing from side to side even more furiously than usual. I bought an extra and
              cross'd to the Metropolitan Hotel (Niblo's,) where the great lamps were still brightly
              blazing, and, with a small crowd of others, who gather'd impromptu, read the news,
              which was evidently authentic. For the benefit of some who had no papers, one of us
              read the telegram aloud, while all listen'd silently and attentively. No remark was
              made by any of the crowd, which had increas'd to thirty or forty, but all stood a
              minute or two, I remember, before they dispers'd. I can almost see them there now,
              under the lamps at midnight again.</p>

              Presidentiads preceding 1861 show'd ho w the weakness and wickedness of rulers are
              just as eligible here in America under republican, as in Europe under dynastic
              influences. But what can I say of that prompt and splendid wrestling with
              Secession-Slavery, the arch enemy personified, the instant he unmistakably show'd his
              face?......The volcanic up heaval of the Nation, after that firing on the flag at
              Charleston, proved for certain something which had been previously in great doubt, and
              at once substantially settled the question of Disunion. In my judgment it will remain
              as the grandest and most encouraging spectacle yet vouchsafed in any age, old or new,
              to political progress and Democracy. It was not for what came to the surface
              merely&#8212;though that was important ; but what it indicated below, which was of
              eternal importance.......Down in the abysms of New World humanity there had form'd and
              harden'd a primal hardpan of National Union Will, determin'd and in the majority,
              refusing to be tamper'd with or argued against, confronting all emergencies, and
              capable at any time of bursting all surface-bonds, and breaking out like an
              earthquake. It is indeed the best lesson of the century, or of America, and it is a
              mighty privilege to have been part of it.......(Two great spectacles, immortal proofs
              of Democracy, unequall'd in all the history of the past, are furnish'd by this
              War&#8212;one at the beginning, the other at its close. Those are&#8212;the general

              bombardment of Sumter, however, the gravity of the revolt, and the power and will of
              the Slave States for a strong and continued military resistance to National authority,
              was not at all realized through the North, except by a few. Nine-tenths of the people
              of the Free States look'd upon the rebellion, as started in South Carolina, from a
              feeling one-half of contempt and the other half composed of anger and incredulity. It
              was not thought it would be join'd in by Virginia, North Carolina or Georgia. A great
              and cautious National official predicted that it would blow over 'in sixty days,' and
              folks generally believ'd the prediction. I remember talking about it on a Fulton
              terry-boat with the Brooklyn Mayor, who said he only 'hoped the Southern fire-eaters
              would commit some overt act of resistance, as they would then be at once so
              effectually squelch'd,we would never hear of Secession again&#8212;but he was afraid
              they never would have the pluck to really do anything.'.......I remember too that a
              couple of companies of the Thirteenth Brooklyn, who rendezvou'd at the City Armory,
              and started thence as Thirty Days' Men, were all provided with pieces of rope
              conspicuously tied to their musket barrels, with which to bring back each man a
              prisoner from the audacious South, to be led in a noose, on our men's early and
              triumphal return ! [This was indeed the general feeling, and came to the surface.
              Still, there was a very strong Secession party at the North, as I shall mention in a
              Note further on.]</p>

              (All battles, and their results, are far more matters of accident than is generally
              thought ; but this was throughout a casualty, a chance. Each side supposed it had won,

              other. By a fiction, or series of fictions, the National forces, at the last moment,
              exploded in a panic, and fled from the field.)</p>

            <p>The troops commenced pouring into Washington, over the Long Bridge, at day-light on
              Monday 22d&#8212;day drizzling all through with rain.</p>

            <p>The Saturday and Sunday of the battle, (20th, 21st,) had been parch'd and hot to an
              extreme&#8212;the dust, the grime and smoke, in layers, sweated in, follow'd by other
              layers, again sweated in, absorb'd by those excited souls&#8212;their clothes all
              saturated with the clay-powder filling the air&#8212;stirr'd up everywhere on the
              dry-roads and trodden fields, by the regiments, swarming wagons, artillery,
              &#38;c.&#8212;all the men, with this coating of murk and sweat and Virginia
              rain&#8212;now recoiling back&#8212;pouring over the Long Bridge, a horrible march of
              twenty miles, returning to Washington baffled, humiliated, panic-struck !......Where
              are the vaunts, and the proud boasts with which you went forth ? Where are your
              banners, and your bands of music, and your ropes to bring back your prisoners? Well,
              there isn't a band playing&#8212;and there isn't a flag but clings ashamed and lank to
              its staif.......The sun rises, but shines not. The men appear, at first sparsely and
              shame-faced enough&#8212;then thicker in the streets of Washington&#8212;appear in
              Pennsylvania avenue, and on the steps and basement entrances. They come along in
              disorderly mobs, some in squads, stragglers, companies. Occasionally, a rare regiment,
              in perfect order, with its officers (some gaps, dead, the true braves,) marching in
              silence, with lowering faces, stern, weary to sinking, all black and dirty, but every
              man with his musket, and stepping alive ;&#8212;but these are the
              exceptions.......Sidewalks of Pennsylvania avenue, Fourteenth street, &#38;c.,
              crowded, jamm'd with citizens, darkies, clerks, everybody, lookers-on ; women in the
              windows, curious expressions from faces, as those swarms of dirt-cover'd return'd
              soldiers there (will they never end ?) move by ; but nothing said, no comments; (half
              our lookers-on Secesh of the most venomous kind&#8212;they say nothing ; but the devil
              snickers in their faces. )</p>

            <p>During the forenoon Washington gets motley with the dirt-cover'd
              soldiers&#8212;queer-looking objects, strange eyes and faces, drench'd (the steady
              rain drizzles on all day) and fearfully worn, hungry, haggard, blister'd in the feet.
              Good people (but not over-many of them either,) hurry up something for their grub.
              They put wash-kettles on the fire, for soup, for coffee. They set tables on the
              side-walks&#8212;wagon loads of bread are purchas'd, swiftly cut in stout chunks. Here
              are two aged ladies, beautiful, the first in the city for culture and charm, they
              stand with store of eating and drink at an improvised table of rough plank, and give
              food, and have the store replenish'd from their house every half-hour all that day ;
              and there in the rain they stand, active, silent, white-hair'd, and give food, though
              the tears stream down their cheeks, almost without intermission, the whole time.</p>

            <p>Amid the deep excitement, crowds and motion, and desperate eagerness, it seems
              strange to see many, very many, of the soldiers sleeping&#8212;in the midst of all,
              sleeping sound. They drop down anywhere, on the steps of houses, up close by the
              basements or fences, on the sidewalk, aside on some vacant lot, and deeply sleep. A
              poor seventeen or eighteen year old boy lies there, on the stoop of a grand house ; he
              sleeps so calmly, so profoundly ! Some clutch their muskets firmly even in sleep. Some
              in squads ; comrades, brothers, close &#8212;and on them, as they lay, sulkily drips
              the rain.</p>

            <p>As afternoon pass'd, and evening came, the streets, the bar-rooms, knots everywhere,
              listeners, questioners, terrible yarns, bugaboo, mask'd batteries, our regiment all
              cut up, &#38;c.,&#8212;stories and story-tellers, windy, bragging, vain centres of
              street-crowds. Resolution, manliness, seem to have abandon'd Washington. The principal
              hotel, Willard's, is full of shoulder-straps&#8212;thick, crush'd, creeping with
              shoulder-straps. (I see them, and must have a word with them. There you are,
              shoulder-straps !&#8212;but where are your companies ? where are your men?
              Incompetents ! never tell me of chances of battle, of getting stray'd, and the like. I
              think this is your work, this retreat, after all. Sneak, blow, put on airs there in
              Willard's sumptuous parlors and bar-rooms, or any where&#8212;no explanation shall
              save you. Bull Run is your work ; had you been half or one-tenth worthy your men, this
              would never have happen'd.)</p>

              hour. She must pack and fly&#8212;no time to spare. Those white palaces&#8212;the
              dome-crown'd Capitol there on the hill, so stately over the trees&#8212;shall they be
              left or destroy'd first ?.......For it is certain that the talk among the magnates and
              officers and clerks and officials everywhere, for twenty-four hours in and around
              Washington, after Bull Run, was loud and undisguised for yielding out and out, and
              substituting the Southern rule, and Lincoln promptly abdicating and departing. If the
              Secesh officers and forces had immediately follow'd, and by a bold Napoleonic
              movement, had enter'd Washington the first day, (or even the second,) they could have
              had things their own way, and a powerful faction North to back them. One of our
              returning officers express'd in public that night, amid a swarm of officers and
              gentlemen in a crowded room, the opinion that it was useless to fight, that the
              Southerners had made their title clear to their own terms, and that the best course
              for the National Government to pursue was to desist from any further attempt at
              stopping them, and admit them again to the lead on the best terms they were willing to
              grant. Not a voice was rais'd against this judgment amid that large crowd of officers
              and gentlemen. (The fact is, the hour was one of the three or four of those crises we
              had during the fluctuations of four years, when human eyes appear'd at least just as
              likely to see the last breath of the Union as to see it continue.)</p>

            <p>But the hour, the day, the night pass'd, and whatever returns, an hour, a day, a
              night like that can never again return. The President, recovering himself, begins that
              very night&#8212;sternly, rapidly sets about the work of reorganizing his forces, and
              placing himself in positions for future and greater work. If there were nothing else
              of Abraham Lincoln for history to stamp him with, it is enough to send him with his
              wreath to the memory of all future time, that he endured that hour, that day, bitterer
              than gall&#8212;indeed a crucifixion day&#8212;that it did not conquer him&#8212;that
              he unflinchingly stemm'd it, and resolv'd to lift himself and the Union out of it.</p>

            <p>Then the great New York papers at once appear'd, (commencing that very evening, and
              following it up the next morning, and incessantly through many days afterwards,) with
              leaders that rang out over the land, with the loudest, most reverberating ring of
              clearest, wildest bugles, full of encouragement, hope, inspiration, unfaltering
              defiance. Those magnificent editorials ! they never flagg'd for a fortnight. The <hi

                rend="italic">Times</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Evening Post</hi>, and other principal
              papers, were not a whit behind. They came in good time, for they were needed. For in
              the Immiliation of Bull Run, the popular feeling North, from its extreme of
              superciliousness, recoil'd to the depth of gloom and apprehension.</p>

            <p>(Of all the days of the War, there are two especially I can never forget. Those were
              the day following the news, in New York and Brooklyn, of that first Bull Run defeat,
              and the day of Abraham Lincoln's death. I was home in Brooklyn on both occasions. The
              day of the murder we heard the news very early in the morning. Mother prepared
              breakfast&#8212;and other meals afterward&#8212;as usual ; but not a mouthful was
              eaten all day by either of us. We each drank half a cup of coffee ; that was all.
              Little was said. We got every newspaper morning and evening, and the frequent extras
              of that period, and pass'd them silently to each other. )</p>

                of</hi> 1861-'65.&#8212;Looking over my scraps, I find I wrote the following during
              1864, or the latter part of '63 :</p>

            <p>The happening to our America, abroad as well as at home, these years, is indeed most
              strange. The Democratic Republic has paid her to-day the terrible and resplendent
              compliment of the united wish of all the nations of the world that her Union should be
              broken, her future cut off, and that she should be compell'd to descend to the level
              of kingdoms and empires ordinarily great ! There is certainly not one government in
              Europe but is now watching the war in this country, with the ardent prayer that the
              United States may be effectually split, crippled, and dismember'd by it. There is not
              one but would help toward that dismemberment, if it dared. I say such is the ardent
              wish to-day of England and of France, as governments, and of all the nations of
              Europe, as governments. I think indeed it is to-day the real, heartfelt wish of all
              the nations of the world, with the single exception of Mexico&#8212;Mexico, the only
              one to whom we have ever really done wrong, and now the only one who prays for us and
              for our triumph, with genuine prayer.</p>

            <p>Is it not indeed strange ? America, made up of all, cheerfully from the beginning
              opening her arms to all, the result and justifier of all, of Britain, Germany, France
              and Spain&#8212;all here&#8212;the accepter, the friend, hope, last resource and
              general house of all&#8212;she who has harm'd none, but been bounteous to so many, to
              millions, the mother of strangers and exiles, all nations&#8212;should now I say be
              paid this dread compliment of general governmental fear and hatred ?.......Are we
              indignant ? alarm'd ? Do we feel wrong'd ? jeopardized ? No ; help'd, braced,
              concentrated, rather. We are all too prone to wander from ourselves, to affect Europe,
              and watch her frowns and smiles. We need this hot lesson of general hatred, and
              henceforth must never forget it. Never again will we trust the moral sense nor
              abstract friendliness of a single <hi rend="italic">government</hi> of the old

              has seen physiognomies (often old farmers, sea-captains, and such) that, behind their
              homeliness, or even ugliness, held superior points so subtle, yet so palpable, defying
              the lines of art, making the real life of their faces almost as impossible to depict
              as a wild perfume or fruit-taste, or a passionate tone of the living voice.....and
              such was Lincoln's face, the peculiar color, the lines of it, the eyes, mouth,

              the Republic, and always will be. The underlying and principal of those points are yet
              singularly ignored. The Northern States were really just as responsible for that War,
              (in its precedents, foundations, instigations,) as the South. Let me try to give my
              view.</p>

            <p>From the age of 21 to 40, (1840-'60,) I was interested in the political movements of
              the land, not so much as a participant, but as an observer, though a regular voter at
              the elections. I think I was conversant with the springs of action, and their
              workings, not only in New York city and Brooklyn, but understood them in the whole
              country, as I had made leisurely tours through all the Middle States, and partially
              through the Western and Southern, and down to New Orleans, in which city I resided for
              some time. (I was there at the conclusion of the Mexican War&#8212;saw and talk'd with
              Gen. Taylor, and the other generals and officers, who were feted and detain'd several
              days, on their return victorious from that expedition.)</p>

            <p xml:id="ppp.01876.18.1" next="#ppp.01876.18.2">Of course many and very contradictory
              things, specialties, prejudices, Constitutional views, &#38;c., went to make up 'the
              origin of the War&#8212;but perhaps the most significant general fact can be best
              indicated and stated as follows: For twenty-five years previous to the outbreak, the
              controling ' Democratic ' nominating conventions&#8212;startup from their primaries in
              wards or districts, and so expanding to counties, powerful cities, States, and to the
              great President-Naming Conventions&#8212;were getting to represent, and to be composed
              of, more and more putrid and dangerous materials. Let me give a schedule, or</p>
          </div1>

          <pb facs="ppp.01876.0246.jpg" xml:id="leaf123v" n="64" type="verso"/>

          <div1 type="section" xml:id="ppp.01876.100" prev="#ppp.01876.099" next="#ppp.01876.101">
            <p xml:id="ppp.01876.18.2" prev="#ppp.01876.18.1" next="#ppp.01876.18.3">list, of one of
              these representative Conventions for a long time before, and inclusive of, that which
              nominated Buchanan. (Remember they had come to be the fountains and tissues of the
              American body politic, forming, as it were, the whole blood, legislation,
              office-holding, &#38;c.) One of these Conventions from 1840 to '60 exhibited a
              spectacle such as could never be seen except in our own age and in These States. The
              members who composed it were, seven-eighths of them, office-holders, office-seekers,
              pimps, malignants, conspirators, murderers, fancy-men, custom-house clerks,
              contractors, kept-editors, spaniels well-train'd to carry and fetch, jobbers,
              infidels, disunionists, terrorists, mail-riflers, slave-catchers, pushers of slavery,
              creatures of the President, creatures of would-be Presidents, spies, blowers,
              electioneerers, bawlers, bribers, compromisers, lobbyers, sponges, ruined sports,
              expell'd gamblers, policy-backers, monte-dealers, duelists, carriers of conceal'd
              weapons, deaf men, pimpled men, scarr'd inside with vile disease, gaudy outside with
              gold chains made from the people's money and harlot's money twisted together ;
              crawling, serpentine men, the lousy combings and born freedom-sellers of the earth.
              And whence came they ? From back-yards and bar-rooms ; from out of the custom-houses,
              marshals' offices, post-offices, and gambling hells; from the President's house, the
              jail, the station-house; from unnamed by-places where devilish disunion was hatched at
              midnight ; from political hearses, and from the coffins inside, and from the shrouds
              inside of the coffins ; from the tumors and abscesses of the land ; from the skeletons
              and skulls in the vaults of the federal almshouses ; and from the running sores of the
              great cities.......Such, I say, form'd the entire personnel, the atmosphere, nutriment
              and chyle, of our municipal, State and National Politics&#8212;substantially
              permeating, handling, deciding and wielding everything&#8212;legislation, nominations,
              elections, ' public sentiment ' &#38;c.,&#8212;while the great masses of the people,
              farmers, mechanics and traders, were helpless in their gripe. These conditions were
              mostly prevalent in the North and West, and especially in New York and Philadelphia
              cities ; and the Southern leaders, (bad enough, but of a far higher order,) struck
              hands and affiliated with, and used them.......Is it strange that a thunder-storm
              follow'd such morbid and stifling strata ?</p>

            <p>I say then, that what, as just outlined, heralded and made the ground ready for
              Secession revolt, ought to be held up, through all the future, as the most instructive
              lesson in American Political History&#8212;the most significant warning and
              beacon-light to coming generations.......I say that the sixteenth, seventeenth and
              eighteenth terms of the American Presidency have shown that the villainy and
              shallowness of rulers (back'd by the machinery of great parties) are just as eligible
              to These States as to any foreign despotism, kingdom, or empire&#8212;there is not a
              bit of difference. History is to record those three Presidentiads, and especially the
              administrations of Fillmore and Buchanan, as so far our topmost warning and shame.
              Never were publicly display'd more deform'd, mediocre, snivelling, unreliable,
              false-hearted men ! Never were These States so insulted, and attempted to be betray'd
              ! All the main purposes for which the government was establish'd, were openly denied.
              The perfect equality of slavery with freedom was flauntingly preach'd in the
              North&#8212;nay, the superiority of slavery. The slave trade was proposed to be
              renew'd. Everywhere frowns and misunderstandings&#8212;everywhere exasperations and
              humiliations.......(The Slavery contest is settled&#8212;and the War is over&#8212;yet
              do not those putrid conditions, too many of them, still exist ? still result in
              diseases, fevers, wounds&#8212;not of War and Army Hospitals&#8212;but the wounds and
              diseases of Peace ?)</p>

            <p>Out of those generic influences, mainly in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, &#38;c.,
              arose the attempt at disunion. To philosophical examination, the malignant fever of
              this war shows its embryonic sources, and the original nourishment of its life and
              growth, in the North. I say Secession, below the surface, originated and was brought
              to maturity in the Free States. I allude to the score of years preceding 1860. The
              events of '61 amazed everybody North and South, and burst all prophecies and
              calculations like bubbles. But even then, and during the whole War, the stern fact
              remains that (not only did the North put it down, but) <hi rend="italic">the Secession
                cause had numerically just as many sympathizers in the Free as in the Rebel
                States</hi>.</p>

            <p>As to slavery, abstractly and practically, (its idea, and the determination to
              establish and expand it, especially in the new Territories, the future America,) it is
              too common, I say, to identify it exclusively with the South. In fact down to the
              opening of the War, the whole country had about an equal hand in it. The North had at
              least been just as guilty, if not more guilty ; and the East and West had. The former
              Presidents and Congresses had been guilty&#8212;the Governors and Legislatures of
              every Northern State had been guilty, and the Mayors of New York and other northern
              cities had all been guilty&#8212;their hands were all stain'd.</p>
          </div1>

          <div1 type="section" xml:id="ppp.01876.101" prev="#ppp.01876.100" next="#ppp.01876.102">
            <p>So much for that point, and for the North......As to the inception and direct
              instigation of the War, in the South itself, I shall not attempt interiors or
              complications. Behind all, the idea that it was from a resolute and arrogant
              determination on the part of the extreme Slaveholders, the Calhounites, to carry the
              States Rights' portion of the Constitutional Compact to its farthest verge, and
              Nationalize Slavery, or else disrupt the Union, and found a new Empire, with Slavery
              for its corner-stone, was and is undoubtedly the true theory. (If successful, this
              attempt would of course have destroy'd not only our American Republic, in anything
              like first-class proportions, in itself and its prestige, but forages at least, the
              cause of Liberty and Equality everywhere, and would have been the greatest triumph of
              reaction, and the severest blow to political and every other freedom, possible to
              conceive. Its worst results would have inured to the Southern States themselves.)</p>

            <p>That our National-Democratic experiment, principle, and machinery, could triumphantly
              sustain such a shock, and that the Constitution could weather it, like a ship a storm,
              and come out of it as sound and whole as before, is by far the most signal proof yet
              of the stability of that experiment, Democracy, and of those principles, and that
              Constitution. But the case is not fully stated at that. It is certain to me that the
              United States, by virtue of the Secession War and its results, and through that and
              them only, are now ready to enter, and must certainly enter, upon their genuine career
              in history, as no more torn and divided in their spinal requisites, but a great
              Homogeneous Nation,&#8212;Free States&#8212;all a moral and political unity in
              variety, such as Nature shows in her grandest physical works, and as much greater than
              any mere work of Nature, as the moral and political, the work of man, his mind, his
              soul, are, in their loftiest sense, greater than the merely physical......Out of that
              War not only has the Nationality of The States escaped from being strangled, but more
              than any of the rest, and, in my opinion, more than the North itself, the vital heart
              and breath of the South have escaped as from the pressure of a general nightmare, and
              are now to enter on a life, development, and active freedom, whose realities are
              certain in the future, notwithstanding all the Southern vexations and humiliations of
              the hour&#8212;a development which could not possibly have been achiev'd on any less
              terms, or by any other means than that War, or something equivalent to it. And I
              predict that the South is yet to outstrip the North.</p>

            <p>Then another fact, never hitherto broach'd, Nationally&#8212;probably several facts,
              perhaps paradoxical&#8212;needing rectification&#8212;(for the whole sense and justice
              of the War must not be supposed to be confined to the Northern point of view.) Is
              there not some side from which the Secession cause itself has its justification ? Was
              there ever a great popular movement, or revolt, or revolution, or attempt at
              revolution, without some solid basis interwoven with it, and supporting it ? at least
              something that could be said in behalf of it ?......We are apt to confine our view to
              the few more glaring and more atrocious Southern features&#8212;the arrogance of most
              of the leading men and politicians&#8212;the fearful crime of Slavery itself&#8212;But
              the time will come&#8212;perhaps has come&#8212;to begin to take a Philosophical view
              of the whole affair.</p>

            <p>Already, as I write this concluding Note to my Memoranda, (Summer, 1875,) a new,
              maturing generation has swept in, obliterating with oceanic currents the worst
              reminiscences of the War ; and the passage of time has heal'd over at least its
              deepest scars. Already, the events of 1861-65, and the seasons that immediately
              preceded, as well as those that closely follow'd them, have lost their direct personal
              impression, and the living heat and excitement of their own time, and are being
              marshall'd for casting, or getting ready to be cast, into the cold and bloodless
              electrotype plates of History. Or, if we admit that the savage temper and wide
              differences of opinion, and feelings of wrongs, and mutual recriminations, that led to
              the War, and flamed in its mortal conflagration, may not have yet entirely burnt
              themselves out, the embers of them are dying embers, and a few more winters and
              summers, a few more rains and snows, will surely quench their fires, and leave them
              only as a far off memory. Already the War of Attempted Secession has become a thing of
              the past.</p>

            <p>And now I have myself, in my thought, deliberately come to unite the whole conflict,
              both sides, the South and North, really into One, and to view it as a struggle going
              on within One Identity. Like any of Nature's great convulsions, wars going on within
              herself&#8212;not from separated sets of laws and influences, but the
              same&#8212;really, efforts, conflicts, most violent ones, for deeper harmony, freer
              and larger scope, completer homogeneousness and power.</p>

            <p>What is any Nation, after all&#8212;and what is a human being&#8212;but a struggle
              between conflicting, paradoxical, opposing elements&#8212;and they themselves and
              their most violent contests, important parts of that One Identity, and of its
              development?</p>

              of things (1875) in South Carolina, Mississippi, Louisiana, and other parts of the
              former Slave States&#8212;the utter change and overthrow of their whole social, and
              the greatest coloring feature of their political institutions&#8212;a horror and
              dismay, as of limitless sea and fire, sweeping over them, and substituting the
              confusion, chaos, and measureless degradation and insult of the present&#8212;the
              black domination, but little above the beasts&#8212;viewed as a temporary, deserv'd
              punishment for their Slavery and Secession sins, may perhaps be admissible ; but as a
              permanency of course is not to be consider'd for a moment. (Did the vast mass of the
              blacks, in Slavery in the United States, present a terrible and deeply complicated
              problem through the just ending century ? But how if the mass of the blacks in freedom
              in the U. S. all through the ensuing century, should present a yet more terrible and
              more deeply complicated problem ?)</p>

              obliteration of the old, (in many respects so needing obliteration)&#8212;the Domesday
              Book, and the repartition of the land&#8212;the old impedimenta removed, even by blood
              and ruthless violence, and a new, progressive genesis establish'd. new seeds
              sown&#8212;Time has proved plain enough that, bitter as they were, all these were the
              most salutary series of revolutions that could possibly have happen'd. Out of them,
              and by them mainly, have come, out of Albic, Roman and Saxon England&#8212;and without
              them could not have come&#8212;not only the England of the 500 years down to the
              present, and of the present&#8212;but These States. Nor, except for that terrible
              dislocation and overturn, would These States, as they are, exist to-day.</p>

            <p>Extricating one's-self from the temporary gaucheries of the hour, can there be
              anything more certain than the rehabilitated prosperity of the Southern States, all
              and several, if their growing generations, refusing to be dismay'd by present
              embarrassments and darkness, accept their position in the Union as an immutable fact,
              and like the Middle and Western States, " fly the flag of practical industry and
              business, and adopting the great ideas of America with faith and courage, developing
              their resources, providing for education, abandoning old fictions, leave the Secession
              war and its bygones behind, and resolutely draw a curtain over the past" ?</p>

            <p>I want to see the Southern States, in a better sense than ever, and under the new
              dispensation, again take a leading part in what is emphatically <hi rend="italic"
                >their</hi> Nationality as much as anybody's. Soon, soon, it will begin to be

              much call the History of the United States. Rather, our preparation, or preface. As
              the chief and permanent result of those four years, and the signal triumph of
              Nationalism at the end of them, we now commence that History of the United States,

              (may I not say divine purpose ? only all is divine purpose,) which pursues its own
              will, maybe unconscious of itself&#8212;of which the puerilities often called history,
              are merely crude and temporary emanations, rather than influences or causes? and of
              which the justification is only to be look'd for in the formulations of centuries to
              come? (Let us not be deceiv'd by flatulent fleeting notorieties, political, official,

              permanent and sovereign force, destined to carry on the New World to fulfil its

              giving purpose and finish to it, Conscience, Morals, and all the Spiritual attributes,
              shall surely rise, like spires above some group of edifices, firm-footed on the earth,
              yet scaling space and heaven.</p>

            <p>The old theory of a given country or age, or people, as something isolated and
              standing by itself&#8212;something which only fulfils its luck, eventful or
              uneventful&#8212;or perhaps some meteor, brilliantly flashing on the background or
              foreground of Time&#8212;is indeed no longer advanced among competent minds, as a
              theory for History&#8212;has been supplanted by theories far wider and
              higher........The development of a Nation&#8212;of the American Republic, for
              instance, with all its episodes of peace and war&#8212;the events of the past, and the
              facts of the present aye, the entire political and intellectual processes of our
              common race&#8212;if beheld from a point of view sufficiently comprehensive, would
              doubtless exhibit the same regularity of order and exactness, and the same plan of
              cause and effect, as the crops in the ground, or the rising and setting of the
              stars.</p>

            <p>Great as they are, therefore, and greater far to be, the United States too are but a
              series of steps in the eternal process of creative thought. And here is to my mind
              their final justification, and certain perpetuity. There is in that sublime process,
              in the laws of the Universe&#8212;and, above all, in the moral law&#8212;something
              that would make unsatisfactory, and even vain and contemptible, all the triumphs of
              war, the gains of peace, and the proudest worldly grandeur of all the Nations that
              have ever existed, or that, (ours included,) now exist, except that we constantly see,
              through all their worldly career, however struggling and blind and lame, attempts, by
              all ages, all peoples, according to their development, to reach, to press, to progress
              on, and farther on, to more and more advanced ideals.</p>

            <p>The glory of the Republic of The United States, in my opinion, is to be, that,
              emerging in the light of the Modern and the splendor of Science, and solidly based on
              the past, it is to cheerfully range itself, and its politics are henceforth to come,
              under those universal laws, and embody them, and carry them out to serve them..
              ....And as only that individual becomes truly great who understands well that, (while
              complete in himself in a certain sense,) he is but a part of the divine, eternal
              scheme, and whose special life and laws are adjusted to move in harmonious relations
              with the general laws of Nature, and especially with the moral law, the deepest and
              highest of all, and the last vitality of Man or State&#8212;so those Nations, and so
              the United States, may only become the greatest and the most continuous, by
              understanding well their harmonious relations with entire Humanity and History, and
              all their laws and progress, and sublimed with the creative thought of Deity, through
              all time, past, present and future. Thus will they expand to the amplitude of their
              destiny, and become splendid illustrations and culminating parts of the Kosmos, and of
              Civilization.</p>

              gathering in presence of America, like veil'd giants, original, native, larger
              questions, possibilities, problems, than ever before. To-day, I say, the evolution of
              The United States, (South, and Atlantic Seaboard, and especially of the Mississippi

              own vitality and amplitude, and winding steadily along through the unseen vistas of
              the future, affords the greatest moral and political work in all the so-far progress
              of Humanity. And fortunately, to-day, after the experiments and warnings of a hundred
              years, we can pause and consider and provide for these problems, under more propitious
              circumstances, and new and native lights, and precious even if costly
              experiences&#8212;with more political and material advantages to illumine and solve
              them&#8212;than were ever hitherto possess'd by a Nation.</p>

            <p>Yes : The summing-up of the tremendous moral and military perturbations of 1861-'65,
              and their results&#8212;and indeed of the entire hundred years of the past of our
              National experiment, from its inchoate movement down to the present day,
              (1775-1876)&#8212;is, that they all now launch The United States fairly forth,
              consistently with the entirety of Civilization and Humanity, and in main sort the
              representative of them, leading the van, leading the fleet of the Modern and
