    <p>"Wherever there is any kind of true genius, we have no right to drive it mad by ridicule or
     invective; we must deal with it wisely, justly, fairly. Some of the passages which have been
     selected as evidence of (the poet's) plain speaking, have been wantonly misunderstood. The
     volume, as a whole, is neither profane nor indecent. A little more clothing in our <hi
      rend="italic">uncertain climate</hi> might perhaps have been attended with advantage. . . . To
     us this volume, for the first time, conclusively settles that Mr. Swinburne is not a mere
     brillian rhetorician or melodious twanger of another man's lyre, but authentically a
      poet."&#8212;F<hi rend="smallcaps">RASER'S</hi> M<hi rend="smallcaps">AGAZINE</hi>, Nov.
     1866.</p>

    <p>"There is enough in the volume to have made the fortune of most members of his
      craft."&#8212;T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> S<hi rend="smallcaps">COTSMAN</hi>.</p>

    <p>"The outcry that has been made over his last published volume of 'Poems and Ballads' is not
     very creditable to this critics. . . . Old Testament Poetry has fastened upon his imagination
     quite as strongly as the sublime fatalism of the old Greek dramatists. . . . There is a
     terrible earnestness about these books. . . . That a book thus dealing with the desire of the
     flesh should have been denounced as profligate because it does not paint the outside of the
     Sodom's apple of like colour of the ashes that it shows within, says little indeed for the
     thoroughness of current criticism."&#8212;E<hi rend="smallcaps">XAMINER</hi>.</p>

    <p>"Coarse animalism, draped with the most seductive hues of art and romance. We will not
     analyze the poems; we will not even pretend to give the reasons upon which our opinion is
     based." <hi rend="italic">For sale by Newcomb &#38; Co., Broadway</hi>.&#8212;A<hi

    <p>"The critics seem to be agreed in seizing upon what deserves reprobation without noticing
     what deserves respect. In this way he has been either very blindly or very unfairly dealt
      with."&#8212;P<hi rend="smallcaps">ALL</hi> M<hi rend="smallcaps">ALL</hi> G<hi

    <p>"The theatre of Mr. Swinburne is co-extensive with this knowledge and experience. It will
     expand, and there is no fear of his being denied an audience, or crushed by a critique. He is
     more likely to realize the boast of Nelson, who, finding himself unmentioned in the 'Gazette,'
     declared a day would come when he should have one for himself. We are not in the secret of his
     own defence, or his reappearance. He may or may not withdraw poems which have been impregnated
     by designing criticism with a pruriency which was not their own."&#8212;R<hi rend="smallcaps"
      >EADER</hi>.</p>

    <p>"In every page of these poems we meet with evidence of the fire, the fulness, and the licence
     of youth. Swinburne is a genuine bard: he sneers at proprieties, he never splits hairs; but
     gives full vent to his love and hate&#8212;his contempt and scorn. He laughs at what other
     people revere. He would dance in a cathedral."&#8212;S<hi rend="smallcaps">TIRLING</hi> J<hi
      rend="smallcaps">OURNAL</hi>.</p>

    <p>"It will be a sad day for English poetry when such volumes as this get read and praised by
     the better critics, yet the merit of some of the pieces&#8212;though by no means high&#8212;is
     greater than of anything heretofore published by this admiring friend of Mr. Jones, Mr.
     Whistler, and poor old Landor." <hi rend="italic">For sale by Nichols &#38;

    <p>"This is a collection of miscellaneous pieces of poetry, &#38;c., by that young and promising
     writer, Mr. Algernon Charles Swinburne. The work, originally brought out by Moxon &#38; Co.,
     has been reprinted by Carleton of this city in a very superior and tasteful style. Of the poems
     themselves, they are written in all the ardency of youth, but many of the pieces breathe forth
     a love of freedom, truth and justice in strong but truly poetic language."&#8212;N<hi

    <p>"This is a famous book. The critics are not by any means unanimous in their estimate of
     Swinburne. Some laud him for 'outspoken honesty, earnestness, poetic insight, truth and beauty
     of expression,' while others regard his poems as even of doubtful morality. That he is a true
     poet, a master of nervous English, and very bold, no one ought to deny. Whether his poetry is
     likely to do harm is another question. The ballad commencing</p>

    <p>"Swinburne is unddoubtedly a true poet, having a fine power of expression, which is
     felicitous and ever appropriate. His muse is fired with the stirring fantasies of youth, and
     his warm desires are told in language which by beauty of expression veils somewhat their
      grossness."&#8212;P<hi rend="smallcaps">HILADELPHIA</hi> D<hi rend="smallcaps"

    <p>"No writer of modern times has excited so much interest as Algernon Charles Swinburne.
     Although a very young man, he has exhibited a maturity of intellect that has almost entirely
     disarmed the critics. The striking originality of his productions has astonished the literary
     world, and placed him unquestionably in the front rank of English poets. A recent edition of
     his poems, entitled 'Laus Veneris, and other Poems and Ballads," however has subjected him to a
     more severe ordeal than he has yet met with, and has called forth from his own pen a defence
     which will be published in the second edition of his new volume.</p>
    <p>"There is a music of strength in these poems, outspoken honesty, a sturdy love of freedom,
     earnestness, poetic insight, truth and beauty of expression, beyond anything attained to by
     other of the young poets of the day. In some of the poems are the passions of youth fearlessly
     expressed, and stirring depths that have been stirred hitherto by no poet in his
      youth."&#8212;P<hi rend="smallcaps">HILADELPHIA</hi> A<hi rend="smallcaps">GE</hi>.</p>

    <p>"As our modern critics are very sensitive, the volume of poems was rather warmly denounced.
     The Moxons were alarmed, and copies were called in as fast as possible. Fortunately one fell in
     our way, and we read it through, with the light which the virtuous reviewers had flashed upon
     the book. We found scarcely a poem deserving the censures of the hyper-prudish press. Much was
     in the manly style in which Landor would write about old Greek stories, much in the bold and
     nervous style in which any but an emasculated laureate would write about some of the middle age
     legends and romances. The poems seemed to be bold, manly, vigorous&#8212;with none of the
     effeminacies of Moore, the profanities of Shelley, or the suggestive pruriencies of many modern
     novelists. We could not help exclaiming, 'Where's the harm?' 'Why decry such poems?' They may
     have the faults of fulness, the errors of youth, the warmth of passion, but are in no way worse
     than scores of the poems of half a century ago, and not half so bad as many of the novels
     to-day. However, the censors prevailed, and the volume was withdrawn&#8212;only to be
     republished by Mr. J. Camden Hotten, who, as he&#8212;unlike Messrs. Moxon&#8212;does not sell
     Shelley's Works, has undertaken to give the present volume to the world."&#8212;B<hi
      rend="smallcaps">IRMINGHAM</hi> J<hi rend="smallcaps">OURNAL</hi>.</p>

    <p>"All his poems are remarkable for their rhythmic beauty and wondrous wealth of language and
     exquisite imagery. Even when he has but little to say, his manner of saying that little is so
     musical, that the melody charms us and lingers in the memory like some sweet strain of
      music."&#8212;N<hi rend="smallcaps">EW</hi> H<hi rend="smallcaps">AVEN</hi> P<hi

    <p>"It is difficult to imagine what could have been the impelling motive of Mr. Swinburne in
     offering this collection of his writings to the public. He ought to have been aware that it
     could in no way enhance his reputation as a writer worthy of his age and time. But indeed it
     may very safely be said that if he had stopped short after the publication of the 'Atalanta in
     Calydon,' he would have stood much higher as a poet than he now does. Everything which he has
     since given us</p>

    <p>'Chastelard,' 'Rosamond,' and now the volume before us, has been a step downward. This, it is
     true, is a literary history not sufficiently uncommon to excite our surprise, but it is none
     the less a matter of regret. Unfortunately he possesses an extraordinary grace and power of
     expression, and a melodious felicity in the use of language and of poetic imagery, which
     sometimes invests his worst verses with a charm that half veils their vileness." <hi
      rend="italic">For sale by Davis and Brothers</hi>.&#8212;P<hi rend="smallcaps">ORTLAND</hi>
      P<hi rend="smallcaps">RESS</hi>.</p>

    <p>"Let us hope that the kingdom on earth which the poets help advance, and which already owns
     the constant service of such men as Tennyson, Longfellow, Bryant, Lowell, may not miss the
     brilliant and subtle power of Swinburne's verse."&#8212;B<hi rend="smallcaps">ROOKLYN</hi> U<hi
      rend="smallcaps">NION</hi>.</p>

    <p>"Probably no poet has brought to the simply sensous delights of love, to the subtle relation
     by which passion is kindled in heart of man and woman, by which the soul is subdued and
     disgraced and overwhelmed in intervals of fierce, untamable joy, to its unutterable anguish
     following, more of the graces and allurements and bold, unconcealed delineation of passion,
     than Mr. Swinburne. Byron is coarse and cold beside him. Tom Moore is a wayward, superficial
     chatterer compared to Swinburne. . . . We have no sympathy with the criticism which denounces
     Mr. Swinburne and his poetry as hopelessly bad."&#8212;B<hi rend="smallcaps">ROOKLYN</hi> U<hi
      rend="smallcaps">NION</hi>.</p>

    <p>"It is time that such works should cease to be palmed off on the public under the names of
     authors of good repute, and with the imprint of respectable publishers on their title-pages."
     "In our review of 'Chastelard' we formed so low an estimate of his ability as to deem him an
     utterly over-estimated young man."&#8212;W<hi rend="smallcaps">ASHINGTON</hi> T<hi
      rend="smallcaps">ELEGRAPH</hi>.</p>

    <p>"The poems are all strongly characteristic, musical, and gracefully versified. The fatal
     fault in the eyes of the English critics is the sensual tone of some of the poems, which they
     exaggerate beyond reason and common sense."&#8212;H<hi rend="smallcaps">ARTFORD</hi> C<hi
      rend="smallcaps">OURANT</hi>.</p>

    <p>"The book seems to be written, like Charles Reade's 'Griffith Gaunt' and Walt Whitman's
     'Leaves of Grass,' in a spirit of protest to what Reade terms the 'prurient prudishness' of the
      age."&#8212;W<hi rend="smallcaps">ASHINGTON</hi> S<hi rend="smallcaps">TAR</hi>.</p>

    <p>(<hi rend="italic">Translation</hi>.)</p>

    <p>"There is no form of verse which Swinburne does not handle with mastery. Many of his poems
     are the most lovely melodies in words. The English language can hardly boast greater triumphs
     than in some of Swinburne's lyrics. We should like to see whether he will overcome the present
     pouting of criticism and the public: it is to be hoped that he <hi rend="italic">will</hi>
     overcome it, and as soon as possible."&#8212;B<hi rend="smallcaps">EILAGE ZUR</hi> Z<hi

    <p>D<hi rend="smallcaps">EAR</hi> S<hi rend="smallcaps">COTT</hi>,&#8212;Among various gifts
     which I have received from you, tangible and intangible, was a copy of the original quarto
     edition of Whitman's <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>, which you presented to me soon
     after its first appearance in 1855. At a time when few people on this side of the Atlantic had
     looked into the book, and still fewer had found in it anything save matter for ridicule, you
     had appraised it, and seen that its value was real and great. A true poet and a strong thinker
     like yourself was indeed likely to see that. I read the book eagerly, and perceived that its
     substantiality and power were still ahead of any eulogium with which it might have come
     commended to me&#8212;and, in fact, ahead of most attempts that could be made at verbal
     definition of them.</p>

    <p>Some years afterwards, getting to know our friend Swinburne, I found with much satisfaction
     that he also was an ardent (not of course a <hi rend="italic">blind</hi>) admirer of Whitman.
     Satisfaction, and a degree almost of surprise; for his intense sense of poetic refinement of
     form in his own <pb facs="ppp.00750.018.jpg" xml:id="leaf009v" n="viii" type="verso"/> works,
     and his exacting acuteness as a critic, might have seemed likely to carry him away from Whitman
     in sympathy at least, if not in actual latitude of perception. Those who find the American poet
     "utterly formless," "intolerably rough and floundering," "destitute of the A B C of art," and
     the like, might not unprofitably ponder this very different estimate of him by the author of
      <hi rend="italic">Atalanta in Calydon</hi>.</p>

    <p>May we hope that now, twelve years after the first appearance of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of
      Grass</hi>, the English reading public may be prepared for a selection of Whitman's poems, and
     soon hereafter for a complete edition of them? I trust this may prove to be the case. At any
     rate, it has been a great gratification to me to be concerned in the experiment; and this is

    <p>D<hi rend="smallcaps">URING</hi> the summer of 1867 I had the opportunity (which I had often
     wished for) of expressing in print my estimate and admiration of the works of the American poet
     Walt Whitman.<hi rend="superscript">&#8727;</hi><note type="editorial" xml:id="n1"
      place="bottom" resp="rossetti"><hi rend="superscript">&#8727;</hi> See <hi rend="italic">The
       Chronicle</hi> for 6th July 1867, article <hi rend="italic">Walt Whitman's Poems</hi>.</note>
     Like a stone dropped into a pond, an article of that sort may spread out its concentric circles
     of consequences. One of these is the invitation which I have received to edit a selection from
     Whitman's writings: virtually the first sample of his work ever published in England, and
     offering the first tolerably fair chance he has had of making his way with English readers on
     his own showing. Hitherto, such readers&#8212;except the small percentage of them to whom it
     has happened to come across the poems in some one of their American editions&#8212;have picked
     acquaintance with them only through the medium of newspaper extracts and criticisms, mostly
     short-sighted, sneering, and depreciatory, and rather intercepting than forwarding the candid
      <pb facs="ppp.00750.024.jpg" xml:id="leaf012v" n="2" type="verso"/> construction which people
     might be willing to put upon the poems, alike in their beauties and their aberrations. Some
     English critics, no doubt, have been more discerning&#8212;as W. J. Fox, of old, in the <hi
      rend="italic">Dispatch</hi>, the writer of the notice in the <hi rend="italic">Leader</hi>,
     and of late two in the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
      >London Review;</hi><hi rend="superscript">&#8727;</hi><note type="editorial" xml:id="n2"
      place="bottom" resp="rossetti"><hi rend="superscript">&#8727;</hi> Since this Prefatory Notice
      was written, another eulogistic review of Whitman has appeared&#8212;that by Mr. Robert
      Buchanan, in the <hi rend="italic">Broadway</hi>.</note> but these have been the exceptions
     among us, the great majority of the reviewers presenting that happy and familiar critical
     combination&#8212; scurrility and superciliousness.</p>

    <p>As it was my lot to set down so recently several of the considerations which seem to me most
     essential and most obvious in regard to Whitman's writings, I can scarcely now recur to the
     subject without either repeating something of what I then said, or else leaving unstated some
     points of principal importance. I shall therefore adopt the simplest course&#8212;that of
     summarizing the critical remarks in my former article; after which, I shall leave without
     further development (ample as is the amount of development most of them would claim) the
     particular topics there glanced at, and shall proceed to some other phases of the subject.</p>

    <p>Whitman republished in 1867 his complete poetical works in one moderate-sized volume,
     consisting of the whole <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>, with a sort of supplement
     thereto <pb facs="ppp.00750.025.jpg" xml:id="leaf013r" n="3" type="recto"/> named <hi
      rend="italic">Songs before Parting</hi>,<hi rend="superscript">&#8727;</hi><note
      type="editorial" xml:id="n3" place="bottom" resp="rossetti"><hi rend="superscript"
       >&#8727;</hi> In a copy of the book revised by Whitman himself, which we have seen, this
      title is modified into <hi rend="italic">Songs of Parting</hi>.</note> and of the <hi
      rend="italic">Drum Taps</hi>, with its <hi rend="italic">Sequel</hi>. It has been intimated
     that he does not <choice>
      <sic>exepect</sic>
      <corr>expect</corr>
     </choice> to write any more poems, unless it might be in expression of the religious side of
     man?s nature. However, one poem on the last American harvest, sown and reaped by those who had
     been soldiers in the great war, has already appeared since the volume in question, and has been
     republished in England.</p>

    <p>Whitman's poems present no trace of rhyme, save in a couple or so of chance instances. Parts
     of them, indeed, may be regarded as a warp of prose amid the weft of poetry, such as Shakspeare
     furnishes the precedent for in drama. Still there is a very powerful and majestic rhythmical
     sense throughout.</p>

    <p>Lavish and persistent has been the abuse poured forth upon Whitman by his own countrymen; the
     tricklings of the British press give but a moderate idea of it. The poet is known to repay
     scorn with scorn. Emerson can, however, from the first be claimed as on Whitman's side; nor, it
     is understood after some enquiry, has that great thinker since then retreated from this
     position in fundamentals, although his admiration may have entailed some worry upon him, and
     reports of his recantation have been rife. Of other writers on Whitman's side, expressing
     themselves with no measured enthusiasm, one may cite <pb facs="ppp.00750.026.jpg"
      xml:id="leaf0013v" n="4" type="verso"/> Mr. M. D. Conway; Mr. W. D. O'Connor, who wrote a
     pamphlet named <hi rend="italic">The Good Grey Poet</hi>; and Mr. John Burroughs, author of <hi
      rend="italic">Walt Whitman as Poet and Person</hi>, published quite recently in New York. His
     thorough-paced admirers declare Whitman to be beyond rivalry <hi rend="italic">the</hi> poet of
     the epoch; an estimate which, startling as it will sound at the first, may nevertheless be
     upheld, on the grounds that Whitman is beyond all his competitors a man of the period, one of
     audacious personal ascendant, incapable of all compromise, and an initiator in the scheme and
     form of his works.</p>

    <p>Certain faults are charged against him, and, as far as they are true, shall frankly stand
     confessed&#8212;some of them as very serious faults. Firstly, he speaks on occasion of gross
     things in gross, crude, and plain terms. Secondly, he uses some words absurd or
     ill-constructed, others which produce a jarring effect in poetry, or indeed in any lofty
     literature. Thirdly, he sins from time to time by being obscure, fragmentary, and
     agglomerative&#8212;giving long strings of successive and detached items, not, however, devoid
     of a certain primitive effectiveness. Fourthly, his self-assertion is boundless; yet not always
     to be understood as strictly or merely personal to himself, but sometimes as vicarious, the
     poet speaking on behalf of all men, and every man and woman. These and any other faults appear
     most harshly on a cursory reading; Whitman is a poet who bears and needs to be read as a whole,
     and then <pb facs="ppp.00750.027.jpg" xml:id="leaf0014r" n="5" type="recto"/> the volume and
     torrent of his power carry the disfigurements along with it, and away.</p>

    <p>The subject-matter of Whitman's poems, taken individually, is absolutely miscellaneous: he
     touches upon any and every subject. But he has prefixed to his last edition an "Inscription" in
     the following terms, showing that the key-words of the whole book are two&#8212;"One's-self"
     and "En Masse:"&#8212;</p>

    <p>The book, then, taken as a whole, is the poem both of Personality and of Democracy; and, it
     may be added, of American nationalism. It is <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi> the modern
     poem. It is distinguished also by this peculiarity&#8212;that in it the most literal view of
     things is continually merging into the most rhapsodic or passionately abstract. <choice>
      <orig>Pic-</orig>
      <reg>Picturesqueness</reg>
     </choice>
     <pb facs="ppp.00750.028.jpg" xml:id="leaf014v" n="6" type="verso"/> turesqueness it has, but
     mostly of a somewhat patriarchal kind, not deriving from the "word-painting" of the <hi
      rend="italic">litt&#233;rateur;</hi> a certain echo of the old Hebrew poetry may even be
     caught in it, extra-modern though it is. Another most prominent and pervading quality of the
     book is the exuberant physique of the author. The conceptions are throughout those of a man in
     robust health, and might alter much under different conditions.</p>

    <p>Further, there is a strong tone of paradox in Whitman's writings. He is both a realist and an
     optimist in extreme measure: he contemplates evil as in some sense not existing, or, if
     existing, then as being of as much importance as anything else. Not that he is a materialist;
     on the contrary, he is a most strenuous assertor of the soul, and, with the soul, of the body
     as its infallible associate and vehicle in the present frame of things. Neither does he drift
     into fatalism or indifferentism; the energy of his temperament, and ever-fresh sympathy with
     national and other developments, being an effectual bar to this. The paradoxical element of the
     poems is such that one may sometimes find them in conflict with what has preceded, and would
     not be much surprised if they said at any moment the reverse of whatever they do say. This is
     mainly due to the multiplicity of the aspects of things, and to the immense width of relation
     in which Whitman stands to all sorts and all aspects of them.</p>

    <p>But the greatest of this poet's distinctions is his absolute <pb facs="ppp.00750.029.jpg"
      xml:id="leaf015r" n="7" type="recto"/> and entire originality. He may be termed formless by
     those who, not without much reason to show for themselves, are wedded to the established forms
     and ratified refinements of poetic art; but it seems reasonable to enlarge the canon till it
     includes so great and startling a genius, rather than to draw it close and exclude him. His
     work is practically certain to stand as archetypal for many future poetic efforts&#8212;so
     great is his power as an originator, so fervid his initiative. It forms incomparably the <hi
      rend="italic">largest</hi> performance of our period in poetry. Victor Hugo's <hi
      rend="italic">L&#233;gende des Si&#232;cles</hi> alone might be named with it for largeness,
     and even that with much less of a new starting-point in conception and treatment. Whitman
     breaks with all precedent. To what he himself perceives and knows he has a personal relation of
     the intensest kind; to anything in the way of prescription, no relation at all. But he is saved
     from isolation by the depth of his Americanism; with the movement of his predominant nation he
     is moved. His comprehension, energy, and tenderness, are all extreme, and all inspired by
     actualities. And, as for poetic genius, those who, without being ready to concede that faculty
     to Whitman, confess his iconoclastic boldness and his Titanic power of temperament, working in
     the sphere of poetry, do in effect confess his genius as well.</p>

    <p>Such, still further condensed, was the critical summary which I gave of Whitman's position
     among poets. It <pb facs="ppp.00750.030.jpg" xml:id="leaf015v" n="8" type="verso"/> remains to
     say something a little more precise of the particular qualities of his works. And first, not to
     slur over defects, I shall extract some sentences from a letter which a friend, most highly
     entitled to form and express an opinion on any poetic question&#8212;one, too, who abundantly
     upholds the greatness of Whitman as a poet&#8212;has addressed to me with regard to the
     criticism above condensed. His observations, though severe on this individual point, appear to
     me not other than correct. "I don't think that you quite put strength enough into your blame on
     one side, while you make at least enough of minor faults or eccentricities. To me it seems
     always that Whitman's great flaw is a fault of debility, not an excess of strength &#8212;I
     mean his bluster. His own personal and national self-reliance and arrogance, I need not tell
     you, I applaud, and sympathize and rejoice in; but the blatant ebullience of feeling and
     speech, at times, is feeble for so great a poet of so great a people. He is in part certainly
     the poet of democracy; but not wholly, <hi rend="italic">because</hi> he tries so openly to be,
     and asserts so violently that he is&#8212;always as if he was fighting the case out on a
     platform. This is the only thing I really or greatly dislike or revolt from. On the whole"
     (adds my correspondent) "my admiration and enjoyment of his greatness grow keener and warmer
     every time I think of him"&#8212;a feeling, I may be permitted to observe, which is fully
     shared by myself, and, I suppose, by all who consent in any adequate measure to <choice>
      <orig>re-</orig>
      <reg>recognise</reg>
     </choice></p>

    <pb facs="ppp.00750.031.jpg" xml:id="leaf016r" n="9" type="recto"/>

    <p>cognise Whitman, and to yield themselves to his influence.</p>

    <p>To continue. Besides originality and daring, which have been already insisted upon, width and
     intensity are leading characteristics of his writings&#8212;width both of subject-matter and of
     comprehension, intensity of self-absorption into what the poet contemplates and expresses. He
     scans and presents an enormous panorama, unrolled before him as from a mountain-top; and yet
     whatever most large or most minute or casual thing his eye glances upon, that he enters into
     with a depth of affection which identifies him with it for the time, be the object what it may.
     There is a singular interchange also of actuality and of ideal substratum and suggestion. While
     he sees men, with even abnormal exactness and sympathy, as men, he sees them also "as trees
     walking," and admits us to perceive that the whole show is in a measure spectral and
     unsubstantial, and the mask of a larger and profounder reality beneath it, of which it is
     giving perpetual intimations and auguries. He is the poet indeed of literality, but of
     passionate and significant literality, full of indirections as well as directness, and of
     readings between the lines. If he is the 'cutest of Yankees, he is also as truly an enthusiast
     as any the most typical poet. All his faculties and performance glow into a white heat of
     brotherliness; and there is a <hi rend="italic">poignancy</hi> both of tenderness and of beauty
     about his finer works which <pb facs="ppp.00750.032.jpg" xml:id="leaf016v" n="10" type="verso"
     /> discriminates them quite as much as their modernness, audacity, or any other exceptional
     point. If the reader wishes to see the great and more intimate powers of Whitman in their
     fullest expression, he may consult the <hi rend="italic">Nocturn for the Death of Lincoln;</hi>
     than which it would be difficult to find anywhere a purer, more elevated, more poetic, more
     ideally abstract, or at the same time more pathetically personal, threnody&#8212;uniting the
     thrilling chords of grief, of beauty, of triumph, and of final unfathomed satisfaction. With
     all his singularities, Whitman is a master of words and of sounds: he has them at his
     command&#8212;made for, and instinct with, his purpose&#8212; messengers of unsurpassable
     sympathy and intelligence between himself and his readers. The entire book may be called the
     p&#230;an of the natural man&#8212;not of the merely physical, still less of the disjunctively
     intellectual or spiritual man, but of him who, being a man first and foremost, is therein also
     a spirit and an intellect.</p>

    <p>There is a singular and impressive intuition or revelation of Swedenborg's: that the whole of
     heaven is in the form of one man, and the separate societies of heaven in the forms of the
     several parts of man. In a large sense, the general drift of Whitman's writings, even down to
     the passages which read as most bluntly physical, bear a striking correspondence or analogy to
     this dogma. He takes man, and every organism and faculty of man, as the unit&#8212;the
     datum&#8212;from which all that we know, discern, <pb facs="ppp.00750.033.jpg"
      xml:id="leaf017r" n="11" type="recto"/> and speculate, of abstract and supersensual, as well
     as of concrete and sensual, has to be computed. He knows of nothing nobler than that unit man;
     but, knowing that, he can use it for any multiple, and for any dynamical extension or
     recast.</p>

    <p>Let us next obtain some idea of what this most remarkable poet&#8212;the founder of <hi
      rend="italic">American</hi> poetry rightly to be so called, and the most sonorous poetic voice
     of the tangibilities of actual and prospective democracy&#8212;is in his proper life and
     person.</p>

    <p>Walt Whitman (we infer that he was in fact baptized Walter, like his father, but he always
     uses the name Walt) was born at the farm-village of West Hills, Long Island, in the State of
     New York, and about thirty miles distant from the capital, on the 31st of May 1819. His
     father's family, English by origin, had already been settled in this locality for five
     generations. His mother, named Louisa van Velsor, was of Dutch extraction, and came from Cold
     Spring, Queen's County, about three miles from West Hills. "A fine-looking old lady" she has
     been termed in her advanced age. A large family ensued from the marriage. The father was a
     farmer, and afterwards a carpenter and builder: both parents adhered in religion to "the great
     Quaker iconoclast, Elias Hicks." Walt was schooled at Brooklyn, a suburb of New York, and began
     life at the age of thirteen, working as a printer, later on as a country teacher, and then as a
     miscellaneous press-writer in <pb facs="ppp.00750.034.jpg" xml:id="leaf017v" n="12"
      type="verso"/> New York. From 1837 to 1848 he had, as Mr. Burroughs too promiscuously
     expresses it, "sounded all experiences of life, with all their passions, pleasures, and
     abandonments." In 1849 he began travelling; and became at New Orleans a newspaper editor, and
     at Brooklyn, two years afterwards, a printer. He next followed his father's business of
     carpenter and builder. In 1862, after the breaking-out of the great Civil War, in which his
     enthusiastic unionism and also his anti-slavery feelings attached him inseparably though not
     rancorously to the good cause of the North, he undertook the nursing of the sick and wounded in
     the field, writing also a correspondence in the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>. I am
     informed that it was through Emerson's intervention that he obtained the sanction of President
     Lincoln for this purpose of charity, with authority to draw the ordinary army rations; Whitman
     stipulating at the same time that he would not receive any remuneration for his services. The
     first immediate occasion of his going down to camp was on behalf of his brother,
     Lieutenant-Colonel George W. Whitman, of the 51st New York Veterans, who had been struck in the
     face by a piece of shell at Fredericksburg. From the spring of 1863, this nursing, both in the
     field and more especially in hospital at Washington, became his "one daily and nightly
     occupation;" and the strongest testimony is borne to his measureless self-devotion and
     kindliness in the work, and to the unbounded fascination, a kind of magnetic <pb
      facs="ppp.00750.035.jpg" xml:id="leaf018r" n="13" type="recto"/> attraction and ascendency,
     which he exercised over the patients, often with the happiest sanitary results. Northerner or
     Southerner, the belligerents received the same tending from him. It is said that by the end of
     the war he had personally ministered to upwards of 100,000 sick and wounded. In a Washington
     hospital he caught, in the summer of 1864, the first illness he had ever known, caused by
     poison absorbed into the system in attending some of the worst cases of gangrene. It disabled
     him for six months. He returned to the hospitals towards the beginning of 1865, and obtained
     also a clerkship in the Department of the Interior. It should be added that, though he never
     actually joined the army as a combatant, he made a point of putting down his name on the
     enrollment-lists for the draft, to take his chance as it might happen for serving the country
     in arms. The reward of his devotedness came at the end of June 1865, in the form of dismissal
     from his clerkship by the minister, Mr. Harlan, who learned that Whitman was the author of the
      <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass;</hi> a book whose outspokenness, or (as the official chief
     considered it) immorality, raised a holy horror in the ministerial breast. The poet, however,
     soon obtained another modest but creditable post in the office of the Attorney-General. He
     still visits the hospitals on Sundays, and often on other days as well.</p>

    <p>The portrait of Mr. Whitman reproduced in the present <pb facs="ppp.00750.036.jpg"
      xml:id="leaf018v" n="14" type="verso"/> volume is taken from an engraving after a
     daguerreotype given in the original <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. He is much above
     the average size, and noticeably well-proportioned&#8212;a model of physique and of health,
     and, by natural consequence, as fully and finely related to all physical facts by his bodily
     constitution as to all mental and spiritual facts by his mind and his consciousness. He is now,
     however, old-looking for his years, and might even (according to the statement of one of his
     enthusiasts, Mr. O'Connor) have passed for being beyond the age for the draft when the war was
     going on. The same gentleman, in confutation of any inferences which might be drawn from the
      <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi> by a Harlan or other Holy Willie, affirms that "one
     more irreproachable in his relations to the other sex lives not upon this earth"&#8212;an
     assertion which one must take as one finds it, having neither confirmatory nor traversing
     evidence at hand. Whitman has light blue eyes, a florid complexion, a fleecy beard now grey,
     and a quite peculiar sort of magnetism about him in relation to those with whom he comes in
     contact. His ordinary appearance is masculine and cheerful: he never shows depression of
     spirits, and is sufficiently undemonstrative, and even somewhat silent in company. He has
     always been carried by predilection towards the society of the common people; but is not the
     less for that open to refined and artistic impressions&#8212;fond of operatic and other good
     music, and discerning in works of art. As to <pb facs="ppp.00750.037.jpg" xml:id="leaf019r"
      n="15" type="recto"/> either praise or blame of what he writes, he is totally indifferent, not
     to say scornful&#8212;having in fact a very decisive opinion of his own concerning its calibre
     and destinies. Thoreau, a very congenial spirit, said of Whitman "He is Democracy;" and again,
     "After all, he suggests something a little more than human." Lincoln broke out into the
     exclamation "Well, <hi rend="italic">he</hi> looks like a man!" Whitman responded to the
     instinctive appreciation of the President, considering him (it is said by Mr. Burroughs) "by
     far the noblest and purest of the political characters of the time;" and, if anything can cast,
     in the eyes of posterity, an added halo of brightness round the unsullied personal qualities
     and the great doings of Lincoln, it will assuredly be the written monument reared to him by
     Whitman.</p>

    <p>The best sketch that I know of Whitman as an accessible human individual is that given by Mr.
      Conway.<hi rend="superscript">&#8727;</hi><note type="editorial" xml:id="n4" place="bottom"
      resp="rossetti"><hi rend="superscript">&#8727;</hi> In the <hi rend="italic">Fortnightly
       Review</hi>, 15th October 1866.</note> I borrow from it the following few details. "Having
     occasion to visit New York soon after the appearance of Walt Whitman's book, I was urged by
     some friends to search him out. . . The day was excessively hot, the thermometer at nearly
     100º, and the sun blazed down as only on sandy Long Island can the sun blaze. . . I saw
     stretched upon his back, and gazing up straight at the terrible sun, the man I was seeking.
     With his grey <pb facs="ppp.00750.038.jpg" xml:id="leaf019v" n="16" type="verso"/> clothing,
     his blue-grey shirt, his iron-grey hair, his swart sunburnt face and bare neck, he lay upon the
     brown-and-white grass&#8212;for the sun had burnt away its greenness&#8212; and was so like the
     earth upon which he rested that he seemed almost enough a part of it for one to pass by without
     recognition. I approached him, gave my name and reason for searching him out, and asked him if
     he did not find the sun rather hot. 'Not at all too hot,' was his reply; and he confided to me
     that this was one of his favourite places and attitudes for composing 'poems.' He then walked
     with me to his home, and took me along its narrow ways to his room. A small room of about
     fifteen feet square, with a single window looking out on the barren solitudes of the island; a
     small cot, a wash-stand with a little looking-glass hung over it from a tack in the wall, a
     pine table with pen, ink, and paper, on it; an old line-engraving representing Bacchus, hung on
     the wall, and opposite a similar one of Silenus; these constituted the visible environments of
     Walt Whitman. There was not, apparently, a single book in the room. . . The books he seemed to
     know and love best were the Bible, Homer, and Shakespeare: these he owned, and probably had in
     his pockets while we were talking. He had two studies where he read; one was the top of an
     omnibus, and the other a small mass of sand, then entirely uninhabited, far out in the ocean,
     called Coney Island. . . The only distinguished contemporary he had ever met was the Rev. <pb
      facs="ppp.00750.039.jpg" xml:id="leaf020r" n="17" type="recto"/> Henry Ward Beecher, of
     Brooklyn, who had visited him. . . He confessed to having no talent for industry, and that his
     forte was 'loafing and writing poems:' he was poor, but had discovered that he could, on the
     whole, live magnificently on bread and water. . . On no occasion did he laugh, nor indeed did I
     ever see him smile."</p>

    <p>The first trace of Whitman as a writer is in the pages of the <hi rend="italic">Democratic
      Review</hi> in or about 1841. Here he wrote some prose tales and sketches&#8212;poor stuff
     mostly, so far as I have seen of them, yet not to be wholly confounded with the commonplace.
     One of them is a tragic school-incident, which may be surmised to have fallen under his
     personal observation in his early experience as a teacher. His first poem of any sort was named
      <hi rend="italic">Blood Money</hi>, in denunciation of the Fugitive Slave Law, which severed
     him from the Democratic party. His first considerable work was the <hi rend="italic">Leaves of
      Grass</hi>. He began it in 1853, and it underwent two or three complete re-writings prior to
     its publication at Brooklyn in 1855, in a quarto volume&#8212;peculiar-looking, but with
     something perceptibly artistic about it. The type of that edition was set up entirely by
     himself. He was moved to undertake this formidable poetic work (as indicated in a private
     letter of Whitman's, from which Mr. Conway has given a sentence or two) by his sense of the
     great materials which America could offer for a really American poetry, and by his contempt for
     the current work of his compatriots&#8212;"either <pb facs="ppp.00750.040.jpg"
      xml:id="leaf020v" n="18" type="verso"/> the poetry of an elegantly weak sentimentalism, at
     bottom nothing but maudlin puerilities or more or less musical verbiage, arising out of a life
     of depression and enervation as their result; or else that class of poetry, plays, &amp;c., of
     which the foundation is feudalism, with its ideas of lords and ladies, its imported standard of
     gentility, and the manners of European high-life-below-stairs in every line and verse." Thus
     incited to poetic self-expression, Whitman (adds Mr. Conway) "wrote on a sheet of paper, in
     large letters, these words 'Make the Work,' and fixed it above his table, where he could always
     see it whilst writing. Thenceforth every cloud that flitted over him, every distant sail, every
     face and form encountered, wrote a line in his book."</p>

    <!-- footenote #5 - part 1 -->
    <p>The <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi> excited no sort of notice until a letter from

      Emerson.</note> appeared, expressing a deep sense of its power and magnitude. He termed it
     "the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed." The edition
     of about a thousand copies sold off in less than a year. Towards the end of 1856 a second
     edition in 16mo appeared, printed in New York, also of about a <pb facs="ppp.00750.041.jpg"
      xml:id="leaf021r" n="19" type="recto"/> thousand copies. Its chief feature was an additional
     poem beginning "A Woman waits for me." It excited a considerable storm. Another edition, of
     about four to five thousand copies, duodecimo, came out at Boston in 1860-61, including a
     number of new pieces. The <hi rend="italic">Drum Taps</hi>, consequent upon the war, with their

     1867, as I have already noted, a complete edition of all the poems, including a supplement
     named <hi rend="italic">Songs before Parting</hi>. The first of all the <hi rend="italic"
      >Leaves of Grass</hi>, in point of date, was the long and powerful composition, entitled, <hi
      rend="italic">Walt Whitman</hi>&#8212;perhaps the most typical and memorable of all of his
     productions, but shut out from the present selection for reasons given further on. The final
     edition shows numerous and considerable variations from all its precursors; evidencing once
     again that Whitman is by no means the rough-and-ready writer, panoplied in rude art and
     egotistic self-sufficiency, that many people suppose him to be. Even since this issue, the book
     has been slightly revised by its author's own hand, with a special view to possible English
     circulation. The copy so revised has reached me (through the liberal and friendly hands of Mr.
     Conway) after my selection had already been decided on; and the few departures from the last
     printed text which might on comparison be found in the present volume are due to my having had
     the advantage of following this revised copy. In all other respects I have felt bound to <pb
      facs="ppp.00750.042.jpg" xml:id="leaf021v" n="20" type="verso"/> reproduce the last edition,
     without so much as considering whether here and there I might personally prefer the readings of
     the earlier issues.</p>

    <p>The selection here offered to the English reader contains a little less than half the entire
     bulk of Whitman's poetry. My choice has proceeded upon two simple rules: first, to omit
     entirely every poem which could with any tolerable fairness be deemed offensive to the feelings
     of morals or propriety in this peculiarly nervous age; and, second, to include every remaining
     poem which appeared to me of conspicuous beauty or interest. I have also inserted the very
     remarkable prose preface which Whitman printed in the original edition of <hi rend="italic"
      >Leaves of Grass</hi>, an edition that has become a literary rarity. This preface has not been
     reproduced in any later publication, although its materials have to some extent been worked up
     into poems of a subsequent date.<hi rend="superscript">&#8727;</hi><note type="editorial"
      xml:id="n6" place="bottom" resp="rossetti"><hi rend="superscript">&#8727;</hi> Compare, for
      instance, the Preface, pp. 49, 50, with the poem <hi rend="italic">To a Foiled Revolter or
       Revoltress</hi>, p. 171.</note> From this prose composition, contrary to what has been my
     rule with any of the poems, it has appeared to me permissible to omit two or three short
     phrases which would have shocked ordinary readers, and the retention of which, had I held it
     obligatory, would have entailed the exclusion of the preface itself as a whole.</p>

    <p>A few words must be added as to the indecencies scattered through Whitman's writings.
     Indecencies or improprieties&#8212;or, still better, deforming crudities&#8212;they may rightly
      <pb facs="ppp.00750.043.jpg" xml:id="leaf022r" n="21" type="recto"/> be termed; to call them
     immoralities would be going too far. Whitman finds himself, and other men and women, to be a
     compound of soul and body; he finds that body plays an extremely prominent and determining part
     in whatever he and other mundane dwellers have cognizance of; he perceives this to be the
     necessary condition of things, and therefore, as he fully and openly accepts it, the right
     condition; and he knows of no reason why what is universally seen and known, necessary and
     right, should not also be allowed and proclaimed in speech. That such a view of the matter is
     entitled to a great deal of weight, and at any rate to candid consideration and construction,
     appears to me not to admit of a doubt; neither is it dubious that the contrary view, the only
     view which a mealy-mouthed British nineteenth century admits as endurable, amounts to the
     condemnation of nearly every great or eminent literary work of past time, whatever the century
     it belongs to, the country it comes from, the department of writing it illustrates, or the
     degree or sort of merit it possesses. Tenth, second, or first century before Christ,
     &#8212;first, eighth, fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth, or even eighteenth century
     A.D.&#8212;it is still the same: no book whose subject-matter admits as possible of an
     impropriety according to current notions can be depended upon to fail of containing such
     impropriety,&#8212;can, if those notions are accepted as the canon, be placed with a sense of
     security in the hands of girls and youths, or read aloud to <pb facs="ppp.00750.044.jpg"
      xml:id="leaf022v" n="22" type="verso"/> women; and this holds good just as much of severely
     moral or plainly descriptive as of avowedly playful, knowing, or licentious books. For my part,
     I am far from thinking that earlier state of literature, and the public feeling from which it
     sprang, the wrong ones&#8212;and our present condition the only right one. Equally far
     therefore am I from indignantly condemning Whitman for every startling allusion or expression
     which he has admitted into his book, and which I, from motives of policy, have excluded from
     this selection; except, indeed, that I think many of his tabooed passages are extremely raw and
     ugly on the ground of poetic or literary art, whatever aspect they may bear in morals. I have
     been rigid in exclusion, because it appears to me highly desirable that a fair verdict on
     Whitman should now be pronounced in England on poetic grounds alone; and because it was clearly
     impossible that the book, with its audacities of topic and of expression included, should run
     the same chance of justice, and of circulation through refined minds and hands, which may
     possibly be accorded to it after the rejection of all such peccant poems. As already intimated,
     I have not in a single instance excised any <hi rend="italic">parts</hi> of poems: to do so
     would have been, I conceive, no less wrongful towards the illustrious American than repugnant,
     and indeed unendurable, to myself, who aspire to no Bowdlerian honours. The consequence is that
     the reader loses <hi rend="italic">in toto</hi> several important poems, and some extremely <pb
      facs="ppp.00750.045.jpg" xml:id="leaf023r" n="23" type="recto"/> fine ones&#8212;notably the
     one previously alluded to, of quite exceptional value and excellence, entitled <hi
      rend="italic">Walt Whitman</hi>. I sacrifice them grudgingly; and yet willingly, because I
     believe this to be the only thing to do with due regard to the one reasonable object which a
     selection can subserve&#8212;that of paving the way towards the issue and unprejudiced
     reception of a complete edition of the poems in England. For the benefit of
     misconstructionists, let me add in distinct terms that, in respect of morals and propriety, I
     neither admire nor approve the incriminated passages in Whitman's poems, but on the contrary
     consider that most of them would be much better away; and, in respect of art, I doubt whether
     even one of them deserves to be retained in the exact phraseology it at present exhibits. This,
     however, does not amount to saying that Whitman is a vile man, or a corrupt or corrupting
     writer: he is none of these.</p>

    <p>The only division of his poems into sections, made by Whitman himself, has been noted above:
      <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Songs before Parting,</hi>
     supplementary to the preceding, and <hi rend="italic">Drum Taps</hi>, with their <hi
      rend="italic">Sequel</hi>. The peculiar title, <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>, has
     become almost inseparable from the name of Whitman; it seems to express with some aptness the
     simplicity, universality, and spontaneity, of the poems to which it is applied. <hi
      rend="italic">Songs before Parting</hi> may indicate that these compositions close Whitman's
     poetic roll. <hi rend="italic">Drum Taps</hi> are, of course, <pb facs="ppp.00750.046.jpg"
      xml:id="leaf023v" n="24" type="verso"/> songs of the Civil War, and their <hi rend="italic"
      >Sequel</hi> is mainly on the same theme: the chief poem in this last section being the one on
     the death of Lincoln. These titles all apply to fully arranged series of compositions. The
     present volume is not in the same sense a fully arranged series, but a selection; and the
     relation of the poems <hi rend="italic">inter se</hi> appears to me to depend on altered
     conditions, which, however narrowed they are, it may be as well frankly to recognise in
     practice. I have therefore redistributed the poems (a latitude of action which I trust the
     author may not object to), bringing together those whose subject-matter seems to warrant it,
     however far separated they may possibly be in the original volume. At the same time, I have
     retained some characteristic terms used by Whitman himself, and have named my sections
     respectively&#8212;</p>

    <p>1. Chants Democratic (poems of democracy).<lb/> 2. Drum Taps (war songs).<lb/> 3. Walt
     Whitman (personal poems).<lb/> 4. Leaves of Grass (unclassified poems).<lb/> 5. Songs of
     Parting (missives).<lb/></p>

    <p>The first three designations explain themselves. The fourth, <hi rend="italic">Leaves of
      Grass</hi>, is not so specially applicable to the particular poems of that section here as I
     should have liked it to be; but I could not consent to drop this typical name. The <hi
      rend="italic">Songs of Parting</hi>, my fifth section, are compositions in which the poet
     expresses his own <pb facs="ppp.00750.047.jpg" xml:id="leaf024r" n="25" type="recto"/>
     sentiment regarding his works, in which he forecasts their future, or consigns them to the
     reader's consideration. It deserves mention that, in the copy of Whitman's last American
     edition revised by his own hand as previously noticed, the series termed <hi rend="italic"
      >Songs of Parting</hi> has been recast, and made to consist of poems of the same character as
     those included in my section No. 5.</p>

    <p>Comparatively few of Whitman's poems have been endowed by himself with titles properly so
     called. Most of them are merely headed with the opening words of the poems themselves&#8212;as
     "I was looking a long while;" "To get betimes in Boston Town;" "When lilacs last in the
     door-yard bloomed;" and so on. It seems to me that in a selection such a lengthy and circuitous
     method of identifying the poems is not desirable: I should wish them to be remembered by brief,
     repeatable, and significant titles. I have therefore supplied titles of my own to such pieces
     as bear none in the original edition: wherever a real title appears in that edition, I have
     retained it.</p>

    <p>With these remarks I commend to the English reader the ensuing selection from a writer whom I
     sincerely believe to be, whatever his faults, of the order of <hi rend="italic">great</hi>
     poets, and by no means of pretty good ones. I would urge the reader not to ask himself, and not
     to return any answer to the questions, whether or not this poet is like other
     poets&#8212;whether or not the particular application of rules of art which is found to hold
     good in the works <pb facs="ppp.00750.048.jpg" xml:id="leaf024v" n="26" type="verso"/> of those
     others, and to constitute a part of their excellence, can be traced also in Whitman. Let the
     questions rather be&#8212;Is he powerful? Is he American? Is he new? Is he rousing? Does he
     feel and make me feel? I entertain no doubt as to the response which in due course of time will
     be returned to these questions and such as these, in America, in England, and
     elsewhere&#8212;or to the further question, "Is Whitman then indeed a true and a great poet?"
     Lincoln's verdict bespeaks the ultimate decision upon him, in his books as in his habit as he
     lives&#8212; "Well, <hi rend="italic">he</hi> looks like a man."</p>

    <p>Walt Whitman occupies at the present moment a unique position on the globe, and one which,
     even in past time, can have been occupied by only an infinitesimally small number of men. He is
     the one man who entertains and professes respecting himself the grave conviction that he is the
     actual and prospective founder of a new poetic literature, and a great one&#8212;a literature
     proportional to the material vastness and the unmeasured destinies of America: he believes that
     the Columbus of the continent or the Washington of the States was not more truly than himself
     in the future a founder and upbuilder of this America. Surely a sublime conviction, and
     expressed more than once in magnificent words&#8212;none more so than the lines beginning</p>

    <p>Were the idea untrue, it would still be a glorious dream, which a man of genius might be
     content to live in and die for: but is it untrue? Is it not, on the contrary, true, if not
     absolutely, yet with a most genuine and substantial approximation? I believe it <hi
      rend="italic">is</hi> thus true. I believe that Whitman is one of the huge, as yet mainly
     unrecognised, forces of our time; privileged to evoke, in a country hitherto still asking for
     its poet, a fresh, athletic, and American poetry, and predestined to be traced up to by
     generation after generation of believing and ardent&#8212; let us hope not
     servile&#8212;disciples.</p>

    <p>"Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world." Shelley, who knew what he was
     talking about when poetry was the subject, has said it, and with a profundity of truth. Whitman
     seems in a peculiar degree marked out for "legislation" of the kind referred to. His voice will
     one day be potential or magisterial wherever the English language is spoken&#8212;that is to
     say, in the four corners of the earth; and, in his own American hemisphere, the uttermost
     avatars of democracy will confess him not more their announcer than their inspirer.</p>

    <milestone unit="undeclared" rend="horbar-short-center"/>

    <p>A<hi rend="smallcaps">MERICA</hi> does not repel the past, or what it has produced under its
     forms, or amid other politics, or the idea of castes, or the old religions; accepts the lesson
     with calmness; is not so impatient as has been supposed that the slough still sticks to
     opinions and manners and literature while the life which served its requirements has passed
     into the new life of the new forms; perceives that the corpse is slowly borne from the eating
     and sleeping rooms of the house; perceives that it waits a little while in the door, that it
     was fittest for its days, that its action has descended to the stalwart and well-shaped heir
     who approaches, and that he shall be fittest for his days.</p>

    <p>The Americans, of all nations at any time upon the earth, have probably the fullest poetical
     Nature. The United States themselves are essentially the greatest poem. In the history of the
     earth hitherto the largest and most stirring appear tame and orderly to their <pb
      facs="ppp.00750.052.jpg" xml:id="leaf026v" n="30" type="verso"/> ampler largeness and stir.
     Here at last is something in the doings of man that corresponds with the broadcast doings of
     the day and night. Here is not merely a nation but a teeming nation of nations. Here is action
     untied from strings necessarily blind to particulars and details, magnificently moving in vast
     masses. Here is the hospitality which for ever indicates heroes. Here are the roughs and beards
     and space and ruggedness and nonchalance that the soul loves. Here the performance, disdaining
     the trivial, unapproached in the tremendous audacity of its crowds and groupings and the push
     of its perspective, spreads with crampless and flowing breadth, and showers its prolific and
     splendid extravagance. One sees it must indeed own the riches of the summer and winter, and
     need never be bankrupt while corn grows from the ground, or the orchards drop apples, or the
     bays contain fish, or men beget children.</p>

    <p>Other states indicate themselves in their deputies: but the genius of the United States is
     not best or most in its executives or legislatures, nor in its ambassadors or authors or
     colleges or churches or parlours, nor even in its newspapers or inventors, but always most in
     the common people. Their manners, speech, dress, friendships, &#8212;the freshness and candour
     of their physiognomy&#8212;the picturesque looseness of their carriage&#8212;their deathless
     attachment to freedom&#8212;their aversion to anything indecorous or soft or mean&#8212;the
     practical acknowledgment <pb facs="ppp.00750.053.jpg" xml:id="leaf027r" n="31" type="recto"/>
     of the citizens of one state by the citizens of all other states&#8212;the fierceness of their
     roused resentment&#8212;their curiosity and welcome of novelty&#8212;their self-esteem and
     wonderful sympathy&#8212;their susceptibility to a slight&#8212;the air they have of persons
     who never knew how it felt to stand in the presence of superiors&#8212;the fluency of their
     speech&#8212;their delight in music, the sure symptom of manly tenderness and native elegance
     of soul&#8212;their good temper and open-handedness&#8212;the terrible significance of their
     elections, the President's taking off his hat to them not they to him&#8212;these too are
     unrhymed poetry. It awaits the gigantic and generous treatment worthy of it.</p>

    <p>The largeness of nature or the nation were monstrous without a corresponding largeness and
     generosity of the spirit of the citizen. Not nature, nor swarming states, nor streets and
     steamships, nor prosperous business, nor farms nor capital nor learning, may suffice for the
     ideal of man, nor suffice the poet. No reminiscences may suffice either. A live nation can
     always cut a deep mark, and can have the best authority the cheapest&#8212;namely from its own
     soul. This is the sum of the profitable uses of individuals or states, and of present action
     and grandeur, and of the subjects of poets.&#8212;As if it were necessary to trot back
     generation after generation to the eastern records! As if the beauty and sacredness of the
     demonstrable must fall behind that of the mythical! As if men do not make their mark out of any
     times! As if <pb facs="ppp.00750.054.jpg" xml:id="leaf027v" n="32" type="verso"/> the opening
     of the western continent by discovery, and what has transpired since in North and South
     America, were less than the small theatre of the antique, or the aimless sleep-walking of the
     middle ages! The pride of the United States leaves the wealth and finesse of the cities, and
     all returns of commerce and agriculture, and all the magnitude of geography or shows of
     exterior victory, to enjoy the breed of full-sized men, or one full-sized man unconquerable and
     simple.</p>

    <p>The American poets are to enclose old and new; for America is the race of races. Of them a
     bard is to be commensurate with a people. To him the other continents arrive as contributions:
     he gives them reception for their sake and his own sake. His spirit responds to his country's
     spirit: he incarnates its geography and natural life and rivers and lakes. Mississippi with
     annual freshets and changing chutes, Missouri and Columbia and Ohio and Saint Lawrence with the
     Falls and beautiful masculine Hudson, do not embouchure where they spend themselves more than
     they embouchure into him. The blue breadth over the inland sea of Virginia and Maryland, and
     the sea off Massachusetts and Maine, and over Manhattan Bay and over Champlain and Erie, and
     over Ontario and Huron and Michigan and Superior, and over the Texan and Mexican and Floridian
     and Cuban seas, and over the seas off California and Oregon, is not tallied by the blue breadth
     of the waters <pb facs="ppp.00750.055.jpg" xml:id="leaf028r" n="33" type="recto"/> below more
     than the breadth of above and below is tallied by him. When the long Atlantic coast stretches
     longer, and the Pacific coast stretches longer, he easily stretches with them north or south.
     He spans between them also from east to west, and reflects what is between them. On him rise
     solid growths that offset the growths of pine and cedar and hemlock and live-oak and locust and
     chestnut and cypress and hickory and limetree and cottonwood and tulip-tree and cactus and
     wild-vine and tamarind and persimmon, and tangles as tangled as any cane-brake or swamp, and
     forests coated with transparent ice and icicles, hanging from the boughs and crackling in the
     wind, and sides and peaks of mountains, and pasturage sweet and free as savannah or upland or
     prairie,&#8212;with flights and songs and screams that answer those of the wild-pigeon and
     high-hold and orchard-oriole and coot and surf-duck and redshouldered-hawk and fish-hawk and
     white-ibis and Indian-hen and cat-owl and water-pheasant and qua-bird and pied-sheldrake and
     blackbird and mocking-bird and buzzard and condor and night-heron and eagle. To him the
     hereditary countenance descends, both mother's and father's. To him enter the essences of the
     real things and past and present events&#8212;of the enormous diversity of temperature and
     agriculture and mines&#8212;the tribes of red aborigines&#8212;the weather-beaten vessels
     entering new ports, or making landings on rocky coasts&#8212;the first settlements north or
     south&#8212;the rapid stature and muscle&#8212;the <pb facs="ppp.00750.056.jpg"
      xml:id="leaf028v" n="34" type="verso"/> haughty defiance of '76, and the war and peace and
     formation of the constitution&#8212;the union always surrounded by blatherers, and always calm
     and impregnable&#8212;the perpetual coming of immigrants&#8212;the wharf-hemmed cities and
     superior marine&#8212;the unsurveyed interior&#8212;the loghouses and clearings and wild
     animals and hunters and trappers&#8212;the free commerce&#8212;the fisheries and whaling and
     gold-digging&#8212;the endless gestations of new states&#8212;the convening of Congress every
     December, the members duly coming up from all climates and the uttermost parts&#8212;the noble
     character of the young mechanics and of all free American workmen and workwomen&#8212;the
     general ardour and friendliness and enterprise&#8212;the perfect equality of the female with
     the male&#8212;the large amativeness&#8212;the fluid movement of the population&#8212;the
     factories and mercantile life and labour-saving machinery&#8212;the Yankee swap&#8212;the New
     York firemen and the target excursion&#8212;the southern plantation life&#8212;the character of
     the northeast and of the northwest and southwest&#8212;slavery and the tremulous spreading of
     hands to protect it, and the stern opposition to it which shall never cease till it ceases, or
     the speaking of tongues and the moving of lips cease. For such the expression of the American
     poet is to be transcendent and new. It is to be indirect, and not direct or descriptive or
     epic. Its quality goes through these to <pb facs="ppp.00750.057.jpg" xml:id="leaf029r" n="35"
      type="recto"/> much more. Let the age and wars of other nations be chanted, and their eras and
     characters be illustrated, and that finish the verse. Not so the great psalm of the republic.
     Here the theme is creative, and has vista. Here comes one among the well-beloved stone-cutters,
     and plans with decision and science, and sees the solid and beautiful forms of the future where
     there are now no solid forms.</p>

    <p>Of all nations, the United States, with veins full of poetical stuff, most needs poets, and
     will doubtless have the greatest, and use them the greatest. Their Presidents shall not be
     their common referee so much as their poets shall. Of all mankind, the great poet is the
     equable man. Not in him, but off from him, things are grotesque or eccentric, or fail of their
     sanity. Nothing out of its place is good, and nothing in its place is bad. He bestows on every
     object or quality its fit proportions, neither more nor less. He is the arbiter of the diverse,
     and he is the key. He is the equalizer of his age and land: he supplies what wants supplying,
     and checks what wants checking. If peace is the routine, out of him speaks the spirit of peace,
     large, rich, thrifty, building vast and populous cities, encouraging agriculture and the arts
     and commerce&#8212;lighting the study of man, the soul, immortality&#8212;federal, state or
     municipal government, marriage, health, free-trade, intertravel by land and sea&#8212; <pb
      facs="ppp.00750.058.jpg" xml:id="leaf029v" n="36" type="verso"/> nothing too close, nothing
     too far off,&#8212;the stars not too far off. In war, he is the most deadly force of the war.
     Who recruits him recruits horse and foot: he fetches parks of artillery, the best that engineer
     ever knew. If the time becomes slothful and heavy, he knows how to arouse it: he can make every
     word he speaks draw blood. Whatever stagnates in the flat of custom or obedience or
     legislation, he never stagnates. Obedience does not master him, he masters it. High up out of
     reach, he stands turning a concentrated light; he turns the pivot with his finger; he baffles
     the swiftest runners as he stands, and easily overtakes and envelops them. The time straying
     toward infidelity and confections and persiflage he withholds by his steady faith; he spreads
     out his dishes; he offers the sweet firm-fibred meat that grows men and women. His brain is the
     ultimate brain. He is no arguer, he is judgment. He judges not as the judge judges, but as the
     sun falling around a helpless thing. As he sees the farthest, he has the most faith. His
     thoughts are the hymns of the praise of things. In the talk on the soul and eternity and God,
     off of his equal plane, he is silent. He sees eternity less like a play with a prologue and
     denouement: he sees eternity in men and women,&#8212;he does not see men and women as dreams or
     dots. Faith is the antiseptic of the soul,&#8212;it pervades the common people and preserves
     them: they never give up believing and expecting <pb facs="ppp.00750.059.jpg" xml:id="leaf030r"
      n="37" type="recto"/> and trusting. There is that indescribable freshness and unconsciousness
     about an illiterate person that humbles and mocks the power of the noblest expressive genius.
     The poet sees for a certainty how one not a great artist may be just as sacred and perfect as
     the greatest artist. The power to destroy or remould is freely used by him, but never the power
     of attack. What is past is past. If he does not expose superior models, and prove himself by
     every step he takes, he is not what is wanted. The presence of the greatest poet conquers; not
     parleying or struggling or any prepared attempts. Now he has passed that way, see! after him!
     there is not left any vestige of despair or misanthropy or cunning or exclusiveness, or the
     ignominy of a nativity or colour, or delusion of hell or the necessity of hell; and no man
     thenceforward shall be degraded for ignorance or weakness or sin.</p>

    <p>The greatest poet hardly knows pettiness or triviality. If he breathes into any thing that
     was before thought small, it dilates with the grandeur and life of the universe. He is a
     seer&#8212;he is individual&#8212;he is complete in himself: the others are as good as he; only
     he sees it, and they do not. He is not one of the chorus&#8212;he does not stop for any
     regulation&#8212;he is the President of regulation. What the eyesight does to the rest he does
     to the rest. Who knows the curious mystery of the eyesight? The other senses corroborate
     themselves, but <pb facs="ppp.00750.060.jpg" xml:id="leaf030v" n="38" type="verso"/> this is
     removed from any proof but its own, and foreruns the identities of the spiritual world. A
     single glance of it mocks all the investigations of man, and all the instruments and books of
     the earth, and all reasoning. What is marvellous? what is unlikely? what is impossible or
     baseless or vague? after you have once just opened the space of a peachpit, and given audience
     to far and near and to the sunset, and had all things enter with electric swiftness, softly and
     duly, without confusion or jostling or jam.</p>

    <p>The land and sea, the animals, fishes, and birds, the sky of heaven and the orbs, the
     forests, mountains, and rivers, are not small themes: but folks expect of the poet to indicate
     more than the beauty and dignity which always attach to dumb real objects,&#8212;they expect
     him to indicate the path between reality and their souls. Men and women perceive the beauty
     well enough&#8212;probably as well as he. The passionate tenacity of hunters, woodmen, early
     risers, cultivators of gardens and orchards and fields, the love of healthy women for the manly
     form, seafaring persons, drivers of horses, the passion for light and the open air, all is an
     old varied sign of the unfailing perception of beauty, and of a residence of the poetic, in
     outdoor people. They can never be assisted by poets to perceive: some may, but they never can.
     The poetic quality is not marshalled in rhyme or uniformity, or abstract addresses to things,
     nor in melancholy complaints or good precepts, but is the life of these and much else, <pb
      facs="ppp.00750.061.jpg" xml:id="leaf031r" n="39" type="recto"/> and is in the soul. The
     profit of rhyme is that it drops seeds of a sweeter and more luxuriant rhyme; and, of
     uniformity, that it conveys itself into its own roots in the ground out of sight. The rhyme and
     uniformity of perfect poems show the free growth of metrical laws, and bud from them as
     unerringly and loosely as lilacs or roses on a bush, and take shapes as compact as the shapes
     of chestnuts and oranges and melons and pears, and shed the perfume impalpable to form. The
     fluency and ornaments of the finest poems or music or orations or recitations are not
     independent, but dependent. All beauty comes from beautiful blood and a beautiful brain. If the
     greatnesses are in conjunction in a man or woman, it is enough&#8212;the fact will prevail
     through the universe: but the gaggery and gilt of a million years will not prevail. Who
     troubles himself about his ornaments or fluency is lost. This is what you shall do: love the
     earth and sun and the animals, despise riches, give alms to every one that asks, stand up for
     the stupid and crazy, devote your income and labour to others, hate tyrants, argue not
     concerning God, have patience and indulgence towards the people, take off your hat to nothing
     known or unknown or to any man or number of men, go freely with powerful uneducated persons and
     with the young and with the mothers of families, read these leaves in the open air every season
     of every year of your life, re-examine all you have been told at school or church <pb
      facs="ppp.00750.062.jpg" xml:id="leaf031v" n="40" type="verso"/> or in any book, dismiss
     whatever insults your own soul; and your very flesh shall be a great poem, and have the richest
     fluency, not only in its words, but in the silent lines of its lips and face, and between the
     lashes of your eyes, and in every motion and joint of your body. The poet shall not spend his
     time in unneeded work. He shall know that the ground is always ready ploughed and manured:
     others may not know it, but he shall. He shall go directly to the creation. His trust shall
     master the trust of everything he touches, and shall master all attachment.</p>

    <p>The known universe has one complete lover, and that is the greatest poet. He consumes an
     eternal passion, and is indifferent which chance happens, and which possible contingency of
     fortune or misfortune, and persuades daily and hourly his delicious pay. What balks or breaks
     others is fuel for his burning progress to contact and amorous joy. Other proportions of the
     reception of pleasure dwindle to nothing to his proportions. All expected from heaven or from
     the highest he is rapport with in the sight of the daybreak, or a scene of the winter woods, or
     the presence of children playing, or with his arm round the neck of a man or woman. His love,
     above all love, has leisure and expanse&#8212;he leaves room ahead of himself. He is no
     irresolute or suspicious lover&#8212;he is sure&#8212;he scorns intervals. His experience and
     the showers and thrills <pb facs="ppp.00750.063.jpg" xml:id="leaf032r" n="41" type="recto"/>
     are not for nothing. Nothing can jar him: suffering and darkness cannot&#8212;death and fear
     cannot. To him complaint and jealousy and envy are corpses buried and rotten in the
     earth&#8212;he saw them buried. The sea is not surer of the shore, or the shore of the sea,
     than he is of the fruition of his love, and of all perfection and beauty.</p>

    <p>The fruition of beauty is no chance of hit or miss&#8212;it is inevitable as life&#8212;it is
     exact and plumb as gravitation. From the eyesight proceeds another eyesight, and from the
     hearing proceeds another hearing, and from the voice proceeds another voice, eternally curious
     of the harmony of things with man. To these respond perfections, not only in the committees
     that were supposed to stand for the rest, but in the rest themselves just the same. These
     understand the law of perfection in masses and floods&#8212;that its finish is to each for
     itself and onward from itself&#8212;that it is profuse and impartial&#8212;that there is not a
     minute of the light or dark, nor an acre of the earth or sea, without it&#8212;nor any
     direction of the sky, nor any trade or employment, nor any turn of events. This is the reason
     that about the proper expression of beauty there is precision and balance,&#8212;one part does
     not need to be thrust above another. The best singer is not the one who has the most lithe and
     powerful organ: the pleasure of poems is not in them that take the handsomest measure and
     similes and sound.</p>

    <pb facs="ppp.00750.064.jpg" xml:id="leaf032v" n="42" type="verso"/>

    <p>Without effort, and without exposing in the least how it is done, the greatest poet brings
     the spirit of any or all events and passions and scenes and persons, some more and some less,
     to bear on your individual character, as you hear or read. To do this well is to compete with
     the laws that pursue and follow time. What is the purpose must surely be there, and the clue of
     it must be there; and the faintest indication is the indication of the best, and then becomes
     the clearest indication. Past and present and future are not disjoined but joined. The greatest
     poet forms the consistence of what is to be from what has been and is. He drags the dead out of
     their coffins, and stands them again on their feet: he says to the past, Rise and walk before
     me that I may realize you. He learns the lesson&#8212;he places himself where the future
     becomes present. The greatest poet does not only dazzle his rays over character and scenes and
     passions,&#8212;he finally ascends and finishes all: he exhibits the pinnacles that no man can
     tell what they are for or what is beyond&#8212;he glows a moment on the extremest verge. He is
     most wonderful in his last half-hidden smile or frown: by that flash of the moment of parting
     the one that sees it shall be encouraged or terrified afterward for many years. The greatest
     poet does not moralize or make applications of morals,&#8212;he knows the soul. The soul has
     that measureless pride <pb facs="ppp.00750.065.jpg" xml:id="leaf033r" n="43" type="recto"/>
     which consists in never acknowledging any lessons but its own. But it has sympathy as
     measureless as its pride, and the one balances the other, and neither can stretch too far while
     it stretches in company with the other. The inmost secrets of art sleep with the twain. The
     greatest poet has lain close betwixt both, and they are vital in his style and thoughts.</p>

    <p>The art of art, the glory of expression and the sunshine of the light of letters, is
     simplicity. Nothing is better than simplicity,&#8212;nothing can make up for excess or for the
     lack of definiteness. To carry on the heave of impulse, and pierce intellectual depths, and
     give all subjects their articulations, are powers neither common nor very uncommon. But to
     speak in literature with the perfect rectitude and insousiance of the movements of animals, and
     the unimpeachableness of the sentiment of trees in the woods and grass by the roadside, is the
     flawless triumph of art. If you have looked on him who has achieved it, you have looked on one
     of the masters of the artists of all nations and times. You shall not contemplate the flight of
     the grey-gull over the bay, or the mettlesome action of the blood horse, or the tall leaning of
     sunflowers on their stalk, or the appearance of the sun journeying through heaven, or the
     appearance of the moon afterward, with any more satisfaction than you shall contemplate him.
     The greatest poet has less a marked style, and is more the channel of thoughts and <pb
      facs="ppp.00750.066.jpg" xml:id="leaf033v" n="44" type="verso"/> things without increase or
     diminution, and is the free channel of himself. He swears to his art,&#8212;I will not be
     meddlesome, I will not have in my writing any elegance or effect or originality to hang in the
     way between me and the rest like curtains. I will have nothing hang in the way, not the richest
     curtains. What I tell I tell for precisely what it is. Let who may exalt or startle or
     fascinate or sooth, I will have purposes as health or heat or snow has, and be as regardless of
     observation. What I experience or pourtray shall go from my composition without a shred of my
     composition. You shall stand by my side, and look in the mirror with me.</p>

    <p>The old red blood and stainless gentility of great poets will be proved by their
     unconstraint. A heroic person walks at his ease through and out of that custom or precedent or
     authority that suits him not. Of the traits of the brotherhood of writers, savans, musicians,
     inventors, and artists, nothing is finer than silent defiance advancing from new free forms. In
     the need of poems, philosophy, politics, mechanism, science, behaviour, the craft of art, an
     appropriate native grand opera, shipcraft or any craft, he is greatest forever and forever who
     contributes the greatest original practical example. The cleanest expression is that which
     finds no sphere worthy of itself, and makes one.</p>

    <p>The messages of great poets to each man and woman are,&#8212;Come to us on equal terms, only
     then can you <pb facs="ppp.00750.067.jpg" xml:id="leaf034r" n="45" type="recto"/> understand
     us. We are no better than you; what we enclose you enclose, what we enjoy you may enjoy. Did
     you suppose there could be only one Supreme? We affirm there can be unnumbered Supremes, and
     that one does not countervail another any more than one eyesight countervails another&#8212;and
     that men can be good or grand only of the consciousness of their supremacy within them. What do
     you think is the grandeur of storms and dismemberments, and the deadliest battles and wrecks,
     and the wildest fury of the elements, and the power of the sea, and the motion of nature, and
     of the throes of human desires, and dignity and hate and love? It is that something in the soul
     which says,&#8212;Rage on, whirl on, I tread master here and everywhere; master of the spasms
     of the sky and of the shatter of the sea, master of nature and passion and death, and of all
     terror and all pain.</p>

    <p>The American bards shall be marked for generosity and affection and for encouraging
     competitors: they shall be kosmos&#8212;without monopoly or secrecy&#8212;glad to pass any
     thing to any one&#8212;hungry for equals night and day. They shall not be careful of riches and
     privilege,&#8212;they shall be riches and privilege: they shall perceive who the most affluent
     man is. The most affluent man is he that confronts all the shows he sees by equivalents out of
     the stronger wealth of himself. The American bard shall delineate no class of persons, nor one
     or two out of the strata of interests, nor love most nor <pb facs="ppp.00750.068.jpg"
      xml:id="leaf034v" n="46" type="verso"/> truth most, nor the soul most nor the body most; and
     not be for the eastern states more than the western, or the northern states more than the
     southern.</p>

    <p>Exact science and its practical movements are no checks on the greatest poet, but always his
     encouragement and support. The outset and remembrance are there&#8212; there the arms that
     lifted him first and brace him best&#8212; there he returns after all his goings and comings.
     The sailor and traveller, the anatomist, chemist, astronomer, geologist, phrenologist,
     spiritualist, mathematician, historian, and lexicographer, are not poets; but they are the
     lawgivers of poets, and their construction underlies the structure of every perfect poem. No
     matter what rises or is uttered, they send the seed of the conception of it: of them and by
     them stand the visible proofs of souls. If there shall be love and content between the father
     and the son, and if the greatness of the son is the exuding of the greatness of the father,
     there shall be love between the poet and the man of demonstrable science. In the beauty of
     poems are the tuft and final applause of science.</p>

    <p>Great is the faith of the flush of knowledge, and of the investigation of the depths of
     qualities and things. Cleaving and circling here swells the soul of the poet: yet is president
     of itself always. The depths are fathomless and therefore calm. The innocence and nakedness are
     resumed&#8212;they are neither modest nor immodest. The whole theory of the special and
     supernatural, and all that <pb facs="ppp.00750.069.jpg" xml:id="leaf035r" n="47" type="recto"/>
     was twined with it or educed out of it, departs as a dream. What has ever happened, what
     happens, and whatever may or shall happen, the vital laws enclose all: they are sufficient for
     any case and for all cases&#8212;none to be hurried or retarded&#8212;any miracle of affairs or
     persons inadmissible in the vast clear scheme where every motion, and every spear of grass, and
     the frames and spirits of men and women, and all that concerns them, are unspeakably perfect
     miracles, all referring to all, and each distinct and in its place. It is also not consistent
     with the reality of the soul to admit that there is anything in the known universe more divine
     than men and women.</p>

    <p>Men and women, and the earth and all upon it, are simply to be taken as they are, and the
     investigation of their past and present and future shall be unintermitted, and shall be done
     with perfect candour. Upon this basis philosophy speculates, ever looking toward the poet, ever
     regarding the eternal tendencies of all toward happiness, never inconsistent with what is clear
     to the senses and to the soul. For the eternal tendencies of all toward happiness make the only
     point of sane philosophy. Whatever comprehends less than that&#8212;whatever is less than the
     laws of light and of astronomical motion&#8212;or less than the laws that follow the thief, the
     liar, the glutton, and the drunkard, through this life, and doubtless afterward&#8212;or less
     than vast stretches of time, or the slow <pb facs="ppp.00750.070.jpg" xml:id="leaf035v" n="48"
      type="verso"/> formation of density, or the patient upheaving of strata&#8212; is of no
     account. Whatever would put God in a poem or system of philosophy as contending against some
     being or influence is also of no account. Sanity and ensemble characterize the great
     master:&#8212;spoilt in one principle, all is spoilt. The great master has nothing to do with
     miracles. He sees health for himself in being one of the mass&#8212;he sees the hiatus in
     singular eminence. To the perfect shape comes common ground. To be under the general law is
     great, for that is to correspond with it. The master knows that he is unspeakably great, and
     that all are unspeakably great&#8212;that nothing for instance is greater than to conceive
     children, and bring them up well&#8212;that to be is just as great as to perceive or tell.</p>

    <p>In the make of the great masters the idea of political liberty is indispensable. Liberty
     takes the adherence of heroes wherever men and women exist; but never takes any adherence or
     welcome from the rest more than from poets. They are the voice and exposition of liberty. They
     out of ages are worthy the grand idea,&#8212;to them it is confided, and they must sustain it.
     Nothing has precedence of it, and nothing can warp or degrade it. The attitude of great poets
     is to cheer up slaves, and horrify despots. The turn of their necks, the sound of their feet,
     the motions of their wrists, are full of hazard to the one and hope to the other. Come nigh
     them awhile, and, though they neither speak nor advise, you <pb facs="ppp.00750.071.jpg"
      xml:id="leaf036r" n="49" type="recto"/> shall learn the faithful American lesson. Liberty is
     poorly served by men whose good intent is quelled from one failure or two failures or any
     number of failures, or from the casual indifference or ingratitude of the people, or from the
     sharp show of the tushes of power, or the bringing to bear soldiers and cannon or any penal
     statutes. Liberty relies upon itself, invites no one, promises nothing, sits in calmness and
     light, is positive and composed, and knows no discouragement. The battle rages with many a loud
     alarm and frequent advance and retreat&#8212;the enemy triumphs&#8212;the prison, the
     handcuffs, the iron necklace and anklet, the scaffold, garrote, and lead-balls, do their
     work&#8212;the cause is asleep&#8212;the strong throats are choked with their own
     blood&#8212;the young men drop their eyelashes toward the ground when they pass each other . .
     . . and is liberty gone out of that place? No, never. When liberty goes, it is not the first to
     go, nor the second or third to go: it waits for all the rest to go&#8212;it is the last. When
     the memories of the old martyrs are faded utterly away&#8212;when the large names of patriots
     are laughed at in the public halls from the lips of the orators&#8212;when the boys are no more
     christened after the same, but christened after tyrants and traitors instead&#8212;when the
     laws of the free are grudgingly permitted, and laws for informers and blood-money are sweet to
     the taste of the people&#8212;when I and you walk abroad upon the earth, stung <pb
      facs="ppp.00750.072.jpg" xml:id="leaf036v" n="50" type="verso"/> with compassion at the sight
     of numberless brothers answering our equal friendship, and calling no man master&#8212;and when
     we are elated with noble joy at the sight of slaves&#8212;when the soul retires in the cool
     communion of the night, and surveys its experience, and has much ecstasy over the word and deed
     that put back a helpless innocent person into the gripe of the gripers or into any cruel
     inferiority&#8212;when those in all parts of these states who could easier realize the true
     American character, but do not yet<hi rend="superscript">&#8727;</hi><note type="editorial"

     of politics, planners of sly involutions for their own preferment to city offices or state
     legislatures or the judiciary or Congress or the Presidency, obtain a response of love and
     natural deference from the people, whether they get the offices or no&#8212;when it is better
     to be a bound booby and rogue in office at a high salary than the poorest free mechanic or
     farmer, with his hat unmoved from his head, and firm eyes, and a candid and generous
     heart&#8212;and when servility by town or state or the federal government, or any oppression on
     a large scale or small scale, can be tried on without its own punishment following duly after
     in exact proportion, against the smallest chance of escape&#8212;or rather when all life and
     all the souls of men and women are discharged from any part of the earth&#8212; <pb
      facs="ppp.00750.073.jpg" xml:id="leaf037r" n="51" type="recto"/> then only shall the instinct
     of liberty be discharged from that part of the earth.</p>

    <p>As the attributes of the poets of the kosmos concentre in the real body and soul and in the
     pleasure of things, they possess the superiority of genuineness over all fiction and romance.
     As they emit themselves, facts are showered over with light&#8212;the daylight is lit with more
     volatile light&#8212;also the deep between the setting and rising sun goes deeper many-fold.
     Each precise object or condition or combination or process exhibits a beauty: the
     multiplication-table its&#8212;old age its&#8212;the carpenter's trade its&#8212;the grand
     opera its: the huge-hulled clean-shaped New York clipper at sea under steam or full sail gleams
     with unmatched beauty&#8212;the American circles and large harmonies of government gleam with
     theirs, and the commonest definite intentions and actions with theirs. The poets of the kosmos
     advance through all interpositions and coverings and turmoils and stratagems to first
     principles. They are of use&#8212;they dissolve poverty from its need and riches from its
     conceit. You large proprietor, they say, shall not realize or perceive more than any one else.
     The owner of the library is not he who holds a legal title to it, having bought and paid for
     it. Any one and every one is owner of the library who can read the same through all the
     varieties of tongues and subjects and styles, and in whom they enter with ease, and take
     residence and force toward paternity <pb facs="ppp.00750.074.jpg" xml:id="leaf037v" n="52"
      type="verso"/> and maternity, and make supple and powerful and rich and large. These American
     states, strong and healthy and accomplished, shall receive no pleasure from violations of
     natural models, and must not permit them. In paintings or mouldings or carvings in mineral or
     wood, or in the illustrations of books or newspapers, or in any comic or tragic prints, or in
     the patterns of woven stuffs, or anything to beautify rooms or furniture or costumes, or to put
     upon cornices or monuments or on the prows or sterns of ships, or to put anywhere before the
     human eye indoors or out, that which distorts honest shapes, or which creates unearthly beings
     or places or contingencies, is a nuisance and revolt. Of the human form especially, it is so
     great it must never be made ridiculous. Of ornaments to a work, nothing outr&#233; can be
     allowed; but those ornaments can be allowed that conform to the perfect facts of the open air,
     and that flow out of the nature of the work, and come irrepressibly from it, and are necessary
     to the completion of the work. Most works are most beautiful without ornament. Exaggerations
     will be revenged in human physiology. Clean and vigorous children are conceived only in those
     communities where the models of natural forms are public every day. Great genius and the people
     of these states must never be demeaned to romances. As soon as histories are properly told,
     there is no more need of romances.</p>

    <p>The great poets are also to be known by the absence in <pb facs="ppp.00750.075.jpg"
      xml:id="leaf038r" n="53" type="recto"/> them of tricks, and by the justification of perfect
     personal candour. Then folks echo a new cheap joy and a divine voice leaping from their brains:
     How beautiful is candour! All faults may be forgiven of him who has perfect candour. Henceforth
     let no man of us lie, for we have seen that openness wins the inner and outer world, and that
     there is no single exception, and that never since our earth gathered itself in a mass has
     deceit or subterfuge or prevarication attracted its smallest particle or the faintest tinge of
     a shade&#8212;and that through the enveloping wealth and rank of a state or the whole republic
     of states a sneak or sly person shall be discovered and despised &#8212;and that the soul has
     never been once fooled and never can be fooled&#8212;and thrift without the loving nod of the
     soul is only a f&#156;tid puff&#8212;and there never grew up in any of the continents of the
     globe, nor upon any planet or satellite or star, nor upon the asteroids, nor in any part of
     ethereal space, nor in the midst of density, nor under the fluid wet of the sea, nor in that
     condition which precedes the birth of babes, nor at any time during the changes of life, nor in
     that condition that follows what we term death, nor in any stretch of abeyance or action
     afterward of vitality, nor in any process of formation or reformation anywhere, a being whose
     instinct hated the truth.</p>

    <p>Extreme caution or prudence, the soundest organic health, large hope and comparison and
     fondness for women and children, large alimentiveness and <choice>

     </choice>
     <pb facs="ppp.00750.076.jpg" xml:id="leaf038v" n="54" type="verso"/> ness and causality, with a
     perfect sense of the oneness of nature, and the propriety of the same spirit applied to human
     affairs&#8212;these are called up of the float of the brain of the world to be parts of the
     greatest poet from his birth. Caution seldom goes far enough. It has been thought that the
     prudent citizen was the citizen who applied himself to solid gains, and did well for himself
     and his family, and completed a lawful life without debt or crime. The greatest poet sees and
     admits these economies as he sees the economies of food and sleep, but has higher notions of
     prudence than to think he gives much when he gives a few slight attentions at the latch of the
     gate. The premises of the prudence of life are not the hospitality of it, or the ripeness and
     harvest of it. Beyond the independence of a little sum laid aside for burial-money, and of a
     few clapboards around and shingles overhead on a lot of American soil owned, and the easy
     dollars that supply the year's plain clothing and meals, the melancholy prudence of the
     abandonment of such a great being as a man is to the toss and pallor of years of moneymaking,
     with all their scorching days and icy nights, and all their stifling deceits and underhanded
     dodgings, or infinitesimals of parlours, or shameless stuffing while others starve,&#8212;and
     all the loss of the bloom and odour of the earth, and of the flowers and atmosphere, and of the
     sea, and of the true taste of the women and men you pass or have to do with <pb
      facs="ppp.00750.077.jpg" xml:id="leaf039r" n="55" type="recto"/> in youth or middle age, and
     the issuing sickness and desperate revolt at the close of a life without elevation or
     naïvet&#233;, and the ghastly chatter of a death without serenity or majesty,&#8212;is the
     great fraud upon modern civilization and forethought; blotching the surface and system which
     civilization undeniably drafts, and moistening with tears the immense features it spreads and
     spreads with such velocity before the reached kisses of the soul. Still the right explanation
     remains to be made about prudence. The prudence of the mere wealth and respectability of the
     most esteemed life appears too faint for the eye to observe at all when little and large alike
     drop quietly aside at the thought of the prudence suitable for immortality. What is wisdom that
     fills the thinness of a year or seventy or eighty years, to wisdom spaced out by ages, and
     coming back at a certain time with strong reinforcements and rich presents and the clear faces
     of wedding-guests as far as you can look in every direction running gaily toward you? Only the
     soul is of itself&#8212;all else has reference to what ensues. All that a person does or thinks
     is of consequence. Not a move can a man or woman make that affects him or her in a day or a
     month, or any part of the direct lifetime or the hour of death, but the same affects him or her
     onward afterward through the indirect lifetime. The indirect is always as great and real as the
     direct. The spirit receives from the body just as much as it gives <pb facs="ppp.00750.078.jpg"
      xml:id="leaf039v" n="56" type="verso"/> to the body. Not one name of word or deed&#8212; not
     of the putrid veins of gluttons or rum-drinkers&#8212; not peculation or cunning or betrayal or
     murder&#8212;no serpentine poison of those that seduce women&#8212;not the foolish yielding of
     women&#8212;not of the attainment of gain by discreditable means&#8212;not any nastiness of
     appetite&#8212; not any harshness of officers to men, or judges to prisoners, or fathers to
     sons, or sons to fathers, or of husbands to wives, or bosses to their boys&#8212;not of greedy
     looks or malignant wishes&#8212;nor any of the wiles practised by people upon
     themselves&#8212;ever is or ever can be stamped on the programme, but it is duly realized and
     returned, and that returned in further performances, and they returned again. Nor can the push
     of charity or personal force ever be anything else than the profoundest reason, whether it
     bring arguments to hand or no. No specification is necessary&#8212;to add or subtract or divide
     is in vain. Little or big, learned or unlearned, white or black, legal or illegal, sick or
     well, from the first inspiration down the windpipe to the last expiration out of it, all that a
     male or female does that is vigorous and benevolent and clean is so much sure profit to him or
     her in the unshakable order of the universe and through the whole scope of it forever. If the
     savage or felon is wise, it is well&#8212;if the greatest poet or savant is wise, it is simply
     the same&#8212;if the President or chief justice is wise, it is the same&#8212;if the young
     mechanic or farmer is wise, it is no more or less. <pb facs="ppp.00750.079.jpg"
      xml:id="leaf040r" n="57" type="recto"/> The interest will come round&#8212;all will come
     round. All the best actions of war and peace&#8212;all help given to relatives and strangers,
     and the poor and old and sorrowful, and young children and widows and the sick, and to all
     shunned persons&#8212;all furtherance of fugitives and of the escape of slaves&#8212;all the
     self-denial that stood steady and aloof on wrecks, and saw others take the seats of the
     boats&#8212;all offering of substance or life for the good old cause, or for a friend's sake or
     opinion's sake&#8212;all pains of enthusiasts scoffed at by their neighbours&#8212;all the vast
     sweet love and precious suffering of mothers&#8212; all honest men baffled in strifes recorded
     or unrecorded&#8212; all the grandeur and good of the few ancient nations whose fragments of
     annals we inherit&#8212;and all the good of the hundreds of far mightier and more ancient
     nations unknown to us by name or date or location&#8212;all that was ever manfully begun,
     whether it succeeded or no&#8212; all that has at any time been well suggested out of the
     divine heart of man, or by the divinity of his mouth, or by the shaping of his great
     hands&#8212;and all that is well thought or done this day on any part of the surface of the
     globe, or on any of the wandering stars or fixed stars by those there as we are here &#8212;or
     that is henceforth to be well thought or done by you, whoever you are, or by any
     one&#8212;these singly and wholly inured at their time, and inure now, and will inure always,
     to the identities from which they sprung <pb facs="ppp.00750.080.jpg" xml:id="leaf040v" n="58"
      type="verso"/> or shall spring. Did you guess any of them lived only its moment? The world
     does not so exist&#8212;no parts, palpable or impalpable, so exist&#8212;no result exists now
     without being from its long antecedent result, and that from its antecedent, and so backward
     without the farthest mentionable spot coming a bit nearer the beginning than any other spot. .
     . . . Whatever satisfies the soul is truth. The prudence of the greatest poet answers at last
     the craving and glut of the soul, is not contemptuous of less ways of prudence if they conform
     to its ways, puts off nothing, permits no let-up for its own case or any case, has no
     particular Sabbath or judgment-day, divides not the living from the dead or the righteous from
     the unrighteous, is satisfied with the present, matches every thought or act by its
     correlative, knows no possible forgiveness or deputed atonement&#8212;knows that the young man
     who composedly perilled his life and lost it has done exceeding well for himself, while the man
     who has not perilled his life, and retains it to old age in riches and ease, has perhaps
     achieved nothing for himself worth mentioning&#8212;and that only that person has no great
     prudence to learn who has learnt to prefer real long-lived things, and favours body and soul
     the same, and perceives the indirect assuredly following the direct, and what evil or good he
     does leaping onward and waiting to meet him again&#8212;and who in his spirit in any emergency
     whatever neither hurries or avoids death.</p>

    <pb facs="ppp.00750.081.jpg" xml:id="leaf041r" n="59" type="recto"/>

    <p>The direct trial of him who would be the greatest poet is to-day. If he does not flood
     himself with the immediate age as with vast oceanic tides&#8212;and if he does not attract his
     own land body and soul to himself, and hang on its neck with incomparable love&#8212;and if he
     be not himself the age transfigured&#8212;and if to him is not opened the eternity which gives
     similitude to all periods and locations and processes and animate and inanimate forms, and
     which is the bond of time, and rises up from its inconceivable vagueness and infiniteness in
     the swimming shape of to-day, and is held by the ductile anchors of life, and makes the present
     spot the passage from what was to what shall be, and commits itself to the representation of
     this wave of an hour, and this one of the sixty beautiful children of the wave&#8212;let him
     merge in the general run and wait his development. . . . . . Still, the final test of poems or
     any character or work remains. The prescient poet projects himself centuries ahead, and judges
     performer or performance after the changes of time. Does it live through them? Does it still
     hold on untired? Will the same style, and the direction of genius to similar points, be
     satisfactory now? Has no new discovery in science, or arrival at superior planes of thought and
     judgment and behaviour, fixed him or his so that either can be looked down upon? Have the
     marches of tens and hundreds and thousands of years made willing detours to the right hand and
     the left hand for his sake? Is he <pb facs="ppp.00750.082.jpg" xml:id="leaf041v" n="60"
      type="verso"/> beloved long and long after he is buried? Does the young man think often of
     him? and the young woman think often of him? and do the middle-aged and the old think of
     him?</p>

    <p>A great poem is for ages and ages, in common, and for all degrees and complexions, and all
     departments and sects, and for a woman as much as a man, and a man as much as a woman. A great
     poem is no finish to a man or woman, but rather a beginning. Has any one fancied he could sit
     at last under some due authority, and rest satisfied with explanations, and realize and be
     content and full? To no such terminus does the greatest poet bring&#8212;he brings neither
     cessation nor sheltered fatness and ease. The touch of him tells in action. Whom he takes he
     takes with firm sure grasp into live regions previously unattained. Thenceforward is no rest:
     they see the space and ineffable sheen that turn the old spots and lights into dead vacuums.
     The companion of him beholds the birth and progress of stars, and learns one of the meanings.
     Now there shall be a man cohered out of tumult and chaos. The elder encourages the younger, and
     shows him how: they two shall launch off fearlessly together till the new world fits an orbit
     for itself, and looks unabashed on the lesser orbits of the stars, and sweeps through the
     ceaseless rings, and shall never be quiet again.</p>

    <p>There will soon be no more priests. Their work is <pb facs="ppp.00750.083.jpg"
      xml:id="leaf042r" n="61" type="recto"/> done. They may wait awhile&#8212;perhaps a generation
     or two,&#8212;dropping off by degrees. A superior breed shall take their place&#8212;the gangs
     of kosmos and prophets <hi rend="italic">en masse</hi> shall take their place. A new order
     shall arise; and they shall be the priests of man, and every man shall be his own priest. The
     churches built under their umbrage shall be the churches of men and women. Through the divinity
     of themselves shall the kosmos and the new breed of poets be interpreters of men and women and
     of all events and things. They shall find their inspiration in real objects to-day, symptoms of
     the past and future. They shall not deign to defend immortality, or God, or the perfection of
     things, or liberty, or the exquisite beauty and reality of the soul. They shall arise in
     America, and be responded to from the remainder of the earth.</p>

    <p>The English language befriends the grand American expression&#8212;it is brawny enough, and
     limber and full enough. On the tough stock of a race who, through all change of circumstance,
     was never without the idea of political liberty, which is the animus of all liberty, it has
     attracted the terms of daintier and gayer and subtler and more elegant tongues. It is the
     powerful language of resistance&#8212;it is the dialect of common sense. It is the speech of
     the proud and melancholy races, and of all who aspire. It is the chosen tongue to express
     growth, faith, self-esteem, freedom, justice, equality, friendliness, <pb
      facs="ppp.00750.084.jpg" xml:id="leaf042v" n="62" type="verso"/> amplitude, prudence,
     decision, and courage. It is the medium that shall well nigh express the inexpressible.</p>

    <p>No great literature, nor any like style of behaviour or oratory or social intercourse or
     household arrangements or public institutions, or the treatment by bosses of employed people,
     nor executive detail, or detail of the army or navy, nor spirit of legislation, or courts or
     police, or tuition or architecture, or songs or amusements, or the costumes of young men, can
     long elude the jealous and passionate instinct of American standards. Whether or no the sign
     appears from the mouths of the people, it throbs a live interrogation in every freeman's and
     freewoman's heart after that which passes by, or this built to remain. Is it uniform with my
     country? Are its disposals without ignominious distinctions? Is it for the evergrowing communes
     of brothers and lovers, large, well-united, proud beyond the old models, generous beyond all
     models? Is it something grown fresh out of the fields, or drawn from the sea, for use to me,
     to-day, here? I know that what answers for me, an American, must answer for any individual or
     nation that serves for a part of my materials. Does this answer? or is it without reference to
     universal needs? or sprung of the needs of the less developed society of special ranks? or old
     needs of pleasure overlaid by modern science and forms? Does this acknowledge liberty with
     audible and absolute acknowledgment, and set slavery at nought for life and <pb
      facs="ppp.00750.085.jpg" xml:id="leaf043r" n="63" type="recto"/> death? Will it help breed one
     good shaped man, and a woman to be his perfect and independent mate? Does it improve manners?
     Is it for the nursing of the young of the republic? Does it solve readily with the sweet milk
     of the breasts of the mother of many children? Has it too the old ever-fresh forbearance and
     impartiality? Does it look with the same love on the last born and on those hardening toward
     stature, and on the errant, and on those who disdain all strength of assault outside of their
     own?</p>

    <p>The poems distilled from other poems will probably pass away. The coward will surely pass
     away. The expectation of the vital and great can only be satisfied by the demeanour of the
     vital and great. The swarms of the polished, deprecating, and reflectors, and the polite, float
     off and leave no remembrance. America prepares with composure and goodwill for the visitors
     that have sent word. It is not intellect that is to be their warrant and welcome. The talented,
     the artist, the ingenious, the editor, the statesman, the erudite&#8212;they are not
     unappreciated &#8212;they fall in their place and do their work. The soul of the nation also
     does its work. No disguise can pass on it&#8212;no disguise can conceal from it. It rejects
     none, it permits all. Only toward as good as itself and toward the like of itself will it
     advance half- way. An individual is as superb as a nation when he has the qualities which make
     a superb nation. The soul of <pb facs="ppp.00750.086.jpg" xml:id="leaf043v" n="64" type="verso"
     /> the largest and wealthiest and proudest nation may well go half-way to meet that of its
     poets. The signs are effectual. There is no fear of mistake. If the one is true, the other is
     true. The proof of a poet is that his country absorbs him as affectionately as he has absorbed
     it.</p>

     <l>With the steam-ship, the electric telegraph, the newspaper, <lb/>the wholesale engines of

     <l>With these, and the world-spreading factories, he inter-<lb/>links all geography, all lands;</l>
     <l>&#8212;What whispers are these, O lands, running ahead of <lb/>you, passing under the seas?</l>
     <l>Are all nations communing? is there going to be but one <lb/>heart to the globe?</l>

     <l>Unborn deeds, things soon to be, project their shapes <lb/>around me;</l>
     <l>This incredible rush and heat&#8212;this strange ecstatic fever <lb/>of dreams, O years!</l>

     <l>How society waits unformed, and is between things ended <lb/>and things begun;</l>
     <l>How America is the continent of glories, and of the triumph <lb/>of freedom, and of the

     <l>And how the States are complete in themselves&#8212;And how <lb/>all triumphs and glories are

      <l>No more on the mountains roam, or sail the stormy sea.</l>

     <l>V<hi rend="smallcaps">IGIL</hi> strange I kept on the field one night,</l>
     <l>When you, my son and my comrade, dropped at my side that day.</l>
     <l>One look I but gave, which your dear eyes returned with a look I shall never forget;</l>
     <l>One touch of your hand to mine, O boy, reached up as you lay on the ground.</l>
     <l>Then onward I sped in the battle, the even-contested battle;</l>
     <l>Till, late in the night relieved, to the place at last again I made my way;</l>
     <l>Found you in death so cold, dear comrade&#8212;found your body, son of responding kisses,
      (never again on earth responding;)</l>
     <l>Bared your face in the starlight&#8212;curious the scene&#8212;cool blew the moderate
      night-wind.</l>
     <l>Long there and then in vigil I stood, dimly around me the battle-field spreading;</l>

     <pb facs="ppp.00750.225.jpg" xml:id="leaf113r" n="203" type="recto"/>

     <l>Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet, there in the fragrant silent night.</l>
     <l>But not a tear fell, not even a long-drawn sigh&#8212;Long, long I gazed;</l>
     <l>Then on the earth partially reclining, sat by your side, leaning my chin in my hands;</l>
     <l>Passing sweet hours, immortal and mystic hours, with you, dearest comrade&#8212;Not a tear,
      not a word;</l>
     <l>Vigil of silence, love, and death&#8212;vigil for you, my son and my soldier,</l>
     <l>As onward silently stars aloft, eastward new ones upward stole;</l>
     <l>Vigil final for you, brave boy, (I could not save you, swift was your death,</l>
     <l>I faithfully loved you and cared for you living&#8212;I think we shall surely meet
      again;)</l>
     <l>Till at latest lingering of the night, indeed just as the dawn appeared,</l>
     <l>My comrade I wrapped in his blanket, enveloped well his form,</l>
     <l>Folded the blanket well, tucking it carefully over head, and carefully under feet;</l>
     <l>And there and then, and bathed by the rising sun, my son in his grave, in his rude-dug
      grave, I deposited;</l>
     <l>Ending my vigil strange with that&#8212;vigil of night and battle-field dim;</l>

     <l>I rose from the chill ground, and folded my soldier well in his blanket,</l>
     <l>And buried him where he fell.</l>

     <l>A <hi rend="smallcaps">MARCH</hi> in the ranks hard-pressed, and the road unknown;</l>
     <l>A route through a heavy wood, with muffled steps in the darkness;</l>
     <l>Our army foiled with loss severe, and the sullen remnant retreating;</l>
     <l>Till after midnight glimmer upon us the lights of a dim-lighted building.</l>
     <l>We come to an open space in the woods, and halt by the dim- lighted building;</l>
     <l>'Tis a large old church, at the crossing roads&#8212;'tis now an impromptu hospital;</l>
     <l>&#8212;Entering but for a minute, I see a sight beyond all the pictures and poems ever

     <l>Shadows of deepest, deepest black, just lit by moving candles and lamps,</l>
     <l>And by one great pitchy torch, stationary, with wild red flame and clouds of smoke;</l>
     <l>By these, crowds, groups of forms, vaguely I see, on the floor, some in the pews laid
      down;</l>

     <l>At my feet more distinctly, a soldier, a mere lad, in danger of bleeding to death, (he is
      shot in the abdomen;)</l>
     <l>I staunch the blood temporarily, (the youngster's face is white as a lily;)</l>
     <l>Then before I depart I sweep my eyes o'er the scene fain to absorb it all;</l>
     <l>Faces, varieties, postures beyond description, most in obscurity, some of them dead;</l>
     <l>Surgeons operating, attendants holding lights, the smell of ether, the odour of blood;</l>
     <l>The crowd, O the crowd of the bloody forms of soldiers&#8212; the yard outside also
      filled;</l>
     <l>Some on the bare ground, some on planks or stretchers, some in the death-spasm sweating;</l>
     <l>An occasional scream or cry, the doctor's shouted orders or calls;</l>
     <l>The glisten of the little steel instruments catching the glint of the torches;</l>
     <l>These I resume as I chant&#8212;I see again the forms, I smell the odour;</l>
     <l>Then hear outside the orders given, <hi rend="italic">Fall in, my men, Fall</hi>
      <hi rend="italic">in.</hi></l>
     <l>But first I bend to the dying lad&#8212;his eyes open&#8212;a half-smile gives he me;</l>
     <l>Then the eyes close, calmly close: and I speed forth to the darkness,</l>

     <l>W<hi rend="smallcaps">HILE</hi> my wife at my side lies slumbering, and the wars are over
      long,</l>
     <l>And my head on the pillow rests at home, and the mystic midnight passes,</l>
     <l>And through the stillness, through the dark, I hear, just hear, the breath of my infant,</l>
     <l>There in the room, as I wake from sleep, this vision presses upon me.</l>
     <l>The engagement opens there and then, in my busy brain unreal;</l>
     <l>The skirmishers begin&#8212;they crawl cautiously ahead&#8212;I hear the irregular snap!
      snap!</l>
     <l>I hear the sound of the different missiles&#8212;the short <hi rend="italic">t-h-t!
       t-h-t!</hi> of the rifle-balls;</l>
     <l>I see the shells exploding, leaving small white clouds&#8212;I hear the great shells
      shrieking as they pass;</l>
     <l>The grape, like the hum and whirr of wind through the trees, (quick, tumultuous, now the
      contest rages!)</l>
     <l>All the scenes at the batteries themselves rise in detail before me again;</l>

     <l>The crashing and smoking&#8212;the pride of the men in their pieces;</l>
     <l>The chief gunner ranges and sights his piece, and selects a fuse of the right time;</l>
     <l>After firing, I see him lean aside, and look eagerly off to note the effect;</l>
     <l>&#8212;Elsewhere I hear the cry of a regiment charging&#8212;the young colonel leads himself
      this time, with brandished sword;</l>
     <l>I see the gaps cut by the enemy's volleys, quickly filled up&#8212;no delay;</l>
     <l>I breathe the suffocating smoke&#8212;then the flat clouds hover low, concealing all;</l>
     <l>Now a strange lull comes for a few seconds, not a shot fired on either side;</l>
     <l>Then resumed, the chaos louder than ever, with eager calls, and orders of officers;</l>
     <l>While from some distant part of the field the wind wafts to my ears a shout of applause,
      (some special success;)</l>
     <l>And ever the sound of the cannon, far or near, rousing, even in dreams, a devilish
      exultation, and all the old mad joy, in the depths of my soul;</l>
     <l>And ever the hastening of infantry shifting positions&#8212;batteries, cavalry, moving
      hither and thither;</l>
     <l>The falling, dying, I heed not&#8212;the wounded, dripping and red, I heed not&#8212;some to
      the rear are hobbling;</l>

    <p>W<hi rend="smallcaps">HILE</hi> this Selection was passing through the press, it has been my
     privilege to receive two letters from Mr. Whitman, besides another communicated to me through a
     friend. I find my experience to be the same as that of some previous writers: that, if one
     admires Whitman in reading his books, one loves him on coming into any personal relation with
     him&#8212;even the comparatively distant relation of letter-writing.</p>

    <p>The more I have to thank the poet for the substance and tone of his letters, and some
     particular expressions in them, the more does it become incumbent upon me to guard against any
     misapprehension. He has had nothing whatever to do with this Selection, as to either prompting,
     guiding, or even ratifying it: except only that he did not prohibit my making two or three
     verbal omissions in the <hi rend="italic">Prose Preface to the Leaves of Grass</hi>, and he has
     supplied his own title, <hi rend="italic">President Lincoln's Funeral Hymn</hi>, to a poem
     which, in my Prefatory Notice, is named (by myself) <hi rend="italic">Nocturn for the Death of
      Lincoln</hi>. All admirers of his <pb facs="ppp.00750.425.jpg" xml:id="leaf213r" n="403"
      type="recto"/> poetry will rejoice to learn that there is no longer any doubt of his adding to
     his next edition "a brief cluster of pieces born of thoughts on the deep themes of Death and
     Immortality." A new American edition will be dear to many: a complete English edition ought to
     be an early demand of English poetic readers, and would be the right and crowning result of the
     present Selection.</p>

    <p>Opinions of the Press.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Swinburne here speaks for himself without personality of any kind, but with much general
     expression of scorn, which the small critics have fairly brought down on themselves. It is to
     be regretted that a young poet, from whom much is to be hoped, should be thus forced into
     explanations than can only humiliate those by whom they were required."&#8212;E<hi
      rend="smallcaps">XAMINER</hi>.</p>

    <p>"We have no space to dwell any further upon Mr. Swinburne's defects and excellences. They are
     both very great and remarkable."&#8212;P<hi rend="smallcaps">ALL</hi> M<hi rend="smallcaps"
      >ALL</hi> G<hi rend="smallcaps">AZETTE</hi>.</p>

    <p>"He writes ably and eloquently, in prose worthy of the pen which wrote the lines in
     'Atalanta' and 'Chastelard'&#8212;earnest, graphic, musical. He asserts with singular force
     that a poet is not bound to write even for reviewers, that he has his own thoughts to utter,
     his own taste to please, and while he admits the right of the critic to complain, he only
     demands that the standard of judgment shall be sound and true. He takes his questioned poems,
     and shows from what point of view they were written, and how they should be looked at&#8212;a
     point of view that of a thorough English poet, trained in the classics, and unable to see why
     the grand old stories learned at school and colleges should be mere dry and dusty
      myths."&#8212;B<hi rend="smallcaps">IRMINGHAM</hi> J<hi rend="smallcaps">OURNAL</hi>.</p>

    <p>It is a degradation to dissect such trash as this. Messrs. Moxon and Co. have been blamed for
     the part they have played in relation to the 'Poems and Ballads,</p>

    <pb facs="ppp.00750.428.jpg" xml:id="leaf214v" type="verso"/>

    <p>The <hi rend="italics">Examiner</hi> falls foul of these gentlemen, and declares that they
     are only fit to keep 'a milk-walk for the use of babes.'"&#8212;S<hi rend="smallcaps"
      >UNDAY</hi> G<hi rend="smallcaps">AZETTE</hi>.</p>

    <p>"We highly approve of the defence made by Mr. Swinburne of the liberty of writers, and
     willingly indorse his sentiments:&#8212;'Literature, to be worthy of men, must be large,
     liberal, sincere, and cannot be chaste if she be prudish. Purity and prudishness cannot keept
     house together. Where free speech and fair play are interdicted, foul hints and evil
     suggestions are hatched into f&#339;tid life.'"&#8212;S<hi rend="smallcaps">TIRLING</hi> A<hi
      rend="smallcaps">DVERTISER</hi>.</p>

    <p>"Terrified by the clamour of a literary clique, Mr. Swinburne's publishers have withdrawn
     their name from the title-page of his book. . . . We cannot blame a tradesman for declining to
     carry on the sale of certain goods which may not be to the taste of his best customers or
     supporters. . . . What we find fault with is that the public are not allowed to form an opinion
     for themselves on the matter. The function of journalism is to sift the wheat, but not to burn
     what it conceives to be chaff with unquenchable fire."&#8212;T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> R<hi
      rend="smallcaps">EADER</hi>.</p>

    <p>"In France, as in Germany, such a misrepresentation as even the foremost journals have given
     of Mr. Swinburne's Poems would have been impossible. With such abundance of imagination, such
     plethora of language, such substance of passion, as these volumes contain, there is ample food
     for literary and philosophical criticism, without resorting to the methods that strove to crush
     Leigh Hunt, Hazlitt, and Shelley and Keats, that found profligacy in 'Rimini' and blasphemy in
      'Adonais.'"&#8212;E<hi rend="smallcaps">XAMINER</hi>.</p>

    <p>"Under the title of 'Notes on Poems and Reviews,' Mr. Algernon Charles Swinburne has just
     published, with Mr. Hotten, of Piccadilly, what he apparently designs to be a crushing reply to
     the whole body of his critics, and a triumphant vindication of his own poetic reputation. We,
     the <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi>, however, think the task thus undertaken with so much audacity,
     was in itself too flagrantly outrageous to prove otherwise than an inevitable <hi rend="italic"
      >fiasco</hi>.'"&#8212;T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> S<hi rend="smallcaps">UN</hi>.</p>

    <p>"That his genius is dramatic&#8212;finely dramatic&#8212;we have taken the liberty to observe
     on other occasions; it is certain, too, that whatever this dramatic genius writes, is
     dramatically written; and it is past all dispute, that what a man writes in that way is not to
     be taken as 'the assertion of its author's own feeling and faith.'"&#8212;P<hi rend="smallcaps"
      >ALL</hi> M<hi rend="smallcaps">ALL</hi> G<hi rend="smallcaps">AZETTE</hi>.</p>

    <p>"Swinburne&#8212;like Byron&#8212;has replied to his critics, not in a poem, but in a prose
     pamphlet, entitled 'Notes on Poems and Reviews.' He takes up his poems one by one, tells why he
     wrote them and what he meant, defends himself from the charge of vulgarity, and cites classical
     authority without stint. Mr. Swinburne declares he has never written for the purblind or the
      prurient."&#8212;W<hi rend="smallcaps">M</hi>. C<hi rend="smallcaps">ULLEN</hi> B<hi
      rend="smallcaps">RYANT</hi>'S N.Y. E<hi rend="smallcaps">VENING</hi> P<hi rend="smallcaps"
      >OST</hi>.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Swinburne's defence of his poems is well tinted. Attacks so intemperate as those to
     which his recent volume of Poems and Ballads was subjected lead almost of necessity to a
     reaction . . . Gradually this reaction has set in with strong and <pb facs="ppp.00750.429.jpg"
      xml:id="leaf215r" type="recto"/> what might easily become dangerous force. Men whose opinions
     carry the highest weight in England have pronounced in favour of the victim of so brutal an
     attack, and the most respected organs of public opinion are attempting the rehabilitation of
     the clever&#8212;if too daring young poet. Like all Mr. Swinburne's prose compositions, it has
     the advantage of a splendid style . . . a specimen of English prose. We have a high worship of
     morality, but have no respect whatever for philistinism, and English prudery is the worst and
     least worthy form of philistinism in existence. Mr. Swinburne's merits are so great that when,
     indignant at the pitifulness of English society, and the littleness of English art, he kicks
     over the traces, he should obtain indulgence rather than misrepresentation."&#8212;S<hi
      rend="smallcaps">UNDAY</hi> T<hi rend="smallcaps">IMES</hi>.</p>

    <p>"These [just quoted] passages contain Mr. Swinburne's answer to his detractors. The rest of
     the pamphlet has in it the scorn that a warm-blooded young poet must feel for that which
     produced the need of such an explanation."&#8212;E<hi rend="smallcaps">XAMINER</hi>.</p>

     sincere critical admiration, this essay of Mr. Rossetti's on Mr. Swinburne's recent volume is a
     very candid one, and also one of true critical insight . . . On the whole the criticism of this

    <p>"An accomplished and gifted critic has undertaken the defence . . . A more difficult thing

     apprehensiveness and discrimination which gives to his remarks a real critical value. The poems
     of Mr. Swinburne are a fact in English literature. As an able and well-weighed effort to assist
     and hasten the calm judgment of the future, we think Mr. Rossetti's criticism deserves praise.

    <p>"He has produced a dramatic poem which abounds from the first page to the last in the finest
     constituents of poetry&#8212;in imagination, fancy, feeling, sentiment, passion, and knowledge
     of the human heart and soul, combined with a dominant mastery over every species of verse, from
     the stateliest pomp of epic metre to the fluent sweetness of song. . . . He has something of
     that creative force which all great poets have had, whether they were Greek, Italian, or
     English&#8212;a native and inborn strength, which scholarship may mould, but can never
     originate. If, as we are given to understand, Mr. Swinburne is a young writer, we do not
     hesitate to assert that his volume is extraordinary, not simply for strength and vividness of
     imagination, but (what is far more remarkable with inexperience) for maturity of power, for
     completeness of self-control, for absolute mastery over the turbulent forces of adolescent
     genius. . . . That strange, sad, hopeless mood in which the ancient Greek regarded the
     mysteries of life and death&#8212;that austere setting of the soul against the iron will of
     destiny which is so full of an immense dignity and pathos&#8212;that divinely sorrowful despair
     of things which can suffer to the miserable end, and sees no after compensation, and yet goes
     down to death in majesty, and beauty, and power&#8212;these characteristics of the old Greek
     faith, or want of faith, or whatsoever we may call it, are reflected by Mr. Swinburne with
     amazing truth and discrimination. There are passages in his poem which seem to wring from the
     very roots of human experience the sharpest extract of our griefs."&#8212;L<hi rend="smallcaps"

    <p>"Mr. Swinburne has judged well in his choice of a subject. The legend of Calydon is one of
     the most beautiful in the whole compass of the Greek mythology; fresh, simple, romantic,
     solemn, and pathetic, yet without any of those horrors which shock us in the stories of Thebes
     or Argos&#8212;no Jocasta, no Thyestes, but figures full of heroic truth and nobleness,
     standing out in the clear bright light of the early morning of Greece. . . . A careful study of
     the Attic dramatists has enabled him to catch their manner, and to reproduce felicitously many
     of their turns of expression. The scholar is struck, every few <pb facs="ppp.00750.448.jpg"
      xml:id="leaf224v" type="verso"/> lines, by some phrase which he can fancy a direct translation
     from the Greek, while yet it is in its place both forcible and unaffected. The matter, although
     not really Greek in its essence, is thrown with great cleverness into a mould which almost
     beguiles us into forgetting the author, and imagining that we are listening to one of the
     contemporaries of Euripides who sought to copy the manner of Aeschylus. . . . He is, indeed,
     never more happy than in painting nature, knowing and loving her well, and inspired by her
     beauty into a vivid force and fulness of expression."&#8212;S<hi rend="smallcaps">ATURDAY</hi>

    <p>"The passion of Alth&#230;a is much the finest part of the play. The naturalism of maternal
     instinct struggling with the feeling of what is due to the shade of her mother and her
     brothers, goes far beyond the struggle in Antigone or Orestes. Out of many noble passages
     depicting this feeling we choose the last and most passionate&#8212;passionate beyond the

     endeavour and high devoir to which he has devoted himself in his first appeal to public
     attention, we would remark the sensuousness, brilliancy, and fervour of the lyrics, which here
     and there relieve the more sombre and sterner phases of the poem. . . . Assuredly this is the

     country. . . . A tragedy on the Grecian model, which is remarkable for its intense emotional

    <p>"Not the least remarkable and interesting pages of this volume are those to <pb
      facs="ppp.00750.450.jpg" xml:id="leaf225v" type="vecto"/> which the author has consigned a
     tribute of veneration to the memory of Walter Savage Landor, in two compositions of Greek
     elegiac verse. The first is a dedication addressed to Landor while living, in the form of a
     valediction, on the occasion of his last return to Italy; the second, much the longer of the
     two, an elegy on his death. No one who has felt how the spirit of the Aeschylean tragedy
     breathes through the English poem, will have been surprised to find&#8212;rather, every such
     reader would have been disappointed if he had not found&#8212;that Mr. Swinburne's thoughts
     move with scarcely less ease and freedom on a modern theme (if indeed Landor may be properly
     said to belong to his own age so much as to that of Pericles and Augustus) in the language and
     measures of Callinus and Mimmerus than in his native speech. Of the Greek we will only say that
     it is not that of a Cambridge prize ode, but something much better&#8212;even if more open to
     minute criticism&#8212;than the best of such; not in the least like cento of dainty classical
     phrases, but the fresh original gushing of a true poetical vein, nourished by mastery of the
     foreign language, like that which Landor himself in his Latin poems. . . . It is evidently the
     produce, not of the tender lyrical faculty which so often waits on sensitive youth and
     afterwards fades into the light of common day, nor even of the classical culture of which it is
     itself a signal illustration, but of an affluent and apprehensive genius, which, with ordinary
     care and fair fortune, will take a foremost place in English literature. . . . His abstinence
     from all overdrawn conceits is remarkable in a young poet of any time, and his careful
     avoidance of the shadowy border land of metaphysics and poetry in which so many versifiers of
     our own day take refuge from the open scrutiny of critical sunlight, deserve full praise and
     recognition."&#8212;Edinburgh Review July, 1865.</p>

    <p>Opinions of the Press.</p>

    <p>"The portraits of Mary and of Chastelard are exaggerated, but only as Michael Angelo's heroic
     statues are. The consistent steady madness of Chastelard's passion, which, mad as it is, lies
     deeper than madness, and, wild as it is, burns always without flame, is displayed in a way
     which is most masterly. <pb facs="ppp.00750.451.jpg" xml:id="leaf226r" type="recto"/> As for
     the Queen, we are quite of opinion that Mr. Swinburne has brought that woman to light again. It
     will not do, perhaps, to peer closely into her portrait as it lies in these pages; if we do, we
     become uneasily conscious of blotchy workmanship, with lights too sudden, and shades too deep,
     and broken harmonies of colour. But close the book, and look at the portrait reflected from it
     into the mind, and none was ever painted of her so true. It is a portrait which painters and
     historians alike have only confused; it awaited a poet's hand to this day, and now we have got
     it. So think we, at any rate, and in saying so we do not exhaust the praise which is due to the
     author of 'Chastelard.' The dramatic force of the scenes in the latter half of the poem remains
     to be applauded, but that, luckily for a critic who has come to the end of his tether, is a
     thing which can only be applauded and cannot be described; we give it our homage. But it is
     very much to the purpose of this article, that just when the poem becomes more dramatic its
     faults begin to disappear; and before we come to the admirable scene between Mary and
     Chastelard in prison, we are blinded to whatever remains. The fact seems to be that Mr.
     Swinburne is less a poet than a dramatist; it is certain that he is capable of writing in a way
     which entitles him to small consideration as the one, and to great consideration as the other.
     . . . But in any case it can never be denied that he is a true man of genius."&#8212;P<hi

    <p>"The two principal figures stand out boldly, and on them the poet has bestowed ail the riches
     of his genius. . . . The scene in which, having sent for Chastelard, she talks to him in a
     strange wild mood between love and regretfulness, is extremely subtle and fine. . . . It will
     not be doubted by any one who has the pulse of poetry in his blood that this is noble
     writing&#8212;writing instinct with the highest spirit of the Elizabethan Muse. And in the
     speech o Chastelard, when waiting for the Queen in her chamber, we have something of the large,
     imperial style of Shakspeare himself. . . . The scene between Chastelard and the Queen in
     prison is also pervaded with the highest inspirations of impassioned poetry; and though the
     love-ravings of Chastelard almost pass the bounds commonly permitted to poets, the shadow of
     fate, lying dark and heavy over all, seems to cool and moderate the glow. In passages such as
     these, Mr. Swinburne again proves his right to take a permanent stand among our English poets.
     . . . Of power, he has abundance; of passion, perhaps more than enough; of poetry, in its
     fierce, luminous, and fiery shapes, a wonderful and prodigal richness. . . . Whatever his
     faults, however, he is a man of genius of the most unmistakable mark. We do not know when it
     has fallen to the lost of any poet to produce within one year two such plays as 'Atalanta in
     Calydon' and 'Chastelard'&#8212;dramas conceived and written in two totally distinct styles,
     and with marked success in both. . . . He has earned a conspicuous name with singular
     quickness, and we trust that even greater triumphs lie before him in his onward
      path."&#8212;L<hi rend="smallcaps">ONDON</hi> R<hi rend="smallcaps">EVIEW</hi>, <hi

     truth. In 'Chastelard,' again, we have a splendid example of the poetry that lies in vehement

     Mary Stuart, and she is made to stand before the reader a reality, her nature being wonderfully

     the less sensuous brotherhood of our Northern poets, would join us in denouncing with
     indignation and disgust such a lamentable prostitution of the English muse."&#8212;J<hi

    <p>"There are two parts of the play deserving of special praise&#8212;the second act, and the
     closing scenes of the fifth. It is in these, and more particularly in the latter, that Mr.
     Swinburne displays a combination of dramatic and poetic power beyond what is seen in anything
     that his pen has yet produced. . . . Were it <pb facs="ppp.00750.453.jpg" xml:id="leaf227r"
      type="recto"/> not for their exquisite elegance of expression, these constant exhibitions of
     passion would deserve severe reprobation. . . . Regarding the work as a whole, we must thank
     Mr. Swinburne for a dramatic poem of great power, careful elaboration of plot, artistic
     disposition of scenes; for admirable descriptions of human emotion and passion; for terse,
     forcible, yet sweet expression, and a generally scrupulous melody of rhythm."&#8212;R<hi

    <p>"Mr. Swinburne has written a tragedy, which not only is one of the most remarkable
     productions of modern days, but which in originality of conception and boldness of treatment
     has never been surpassed. The triumph which Mr. Swinburne has achieved in 'Chastelard' is the
     more noteworthy, since the splendid gifts of which its composition proclaims him the possessor
     are totally distinct from those which in 'Atalanta in 'Calydon' gained him a foremost position
     among modern poets. In the earlier production, amid all the sublime imagery and lyrical
     sweetness, the grace truly classic, the boldness of thought and the exquisite charm of
     versification which constituted it a work of accomplished and all out unrivalled beauty, there
     was no foreshadowing of the dramatic fire and the weird and almost unholy power which
     characterize its successor. . . . From this point, where the interest has already reached what
     appears a climax, each situation is more dramatic and more stirring than the one preceding it.
     The skill with which&#8212;the passions being already at white heat&#8212;the action is
     heightened without anti-climax is absolutely wonderful. . . . The last few words we give in
     their integrity; no word of ours can add aught to their terrible pathos and dramatic force.
     With them, and without an added word, we shall conclude our notice of this most remarkable
     tragedy of modern times."&#8212;S<hi rend="smallcaps">UNDAY</hi> T<hi rend="smallcaps"

    <p>"Here, in his new poem of 'Chastelard,' is Mr. Algernon Swinburne writing French chansons of
     which Chastelard himself or Ronsard might have been proud. So good are they that by many they
     are imagined to be merely quotations, transcripts from the original French author. But there is
     no doubt they are Mr. Swinburne's own composition. Here are two which are exquisite in taste,
     feeling, and spirit."&#8212;M<hi rend="smallcaps">ORNING</hi> S<hi rend="smallcaps">TAR</hi>,

    <p>"The public to which Mr. Swinburne appeals will consist exclusively of those readers who
     enjoy a work of art for its own sake, and who care more for the power of the representation
     than for any worth in what is represented. . . . Mr. Swinburne has produced a poem which many
     may dislike but which none can contemn, which many will lay down unread but which few will read
     once only. It cannot be called an advance upon 'Atalanta,' for it is something totally
     different, except in its disregard of conventional proprieties, and its independence of the
     poetical habits of the day. There is the same richness without tawdriness of language, the same
     novelty without strangeness of expression, the same continual sense of the indispensable duty
     of melody in verse, which some of our most pretentious poets either forget or disown. . . . The
     scene in the Queen's chamber is very beautiful, but ingeniously wicked as the rest. . . . For
     dex- <pb facs="ppp.00750.454.jpg" xml:id="leaf227v" type="verso"/> terity of fence, both in
     feeling and language, this scene may rank with the masterpieces of our older drama. . . . The
     gyrations are so unexpected, and the changes so numerous, that in less masterly hands the
     effect would be rather that of a psychological puzzle than of a dramatic evolution. . . . It is
     impossible that this play should not highly raise Mr. Swinburne's reputation. There are
     artistic defects in it, but not to be mentioned beside the artistic merits. His preface to
     Moxon's 'Selections from Byrons' is another instance of the fact, too often forgotten, that
     there is no education for the writig of superior prose like the serious practice of poetry; and
     with this double power, Mr. Swinburne's future career must be an object of much interest to all
     who estimate aright the worth and weight of British literature in the intellectual and moral
     history of mankind."&#8212;F<hi rend="smallcaps">ORTNIGHTLY</hi> R<hi rend="smallcaps"

    <p>"He fills out this bold outline, and supplies missing links in the story, and imparts life
     and form and colour to the whole picture, and reproduces contemporaneous personages and
     scenery, and, with deep probing of human nature and fine play of imagination, unveils the
     pathetic tragedy that has so long slept hidden in the dry and trite historic page. The result
     is a masterpiece of literary art, whether contemplated as to conception of character, ideals of
     love and heroism, treatment of a grand and moving theme, majesty, beauty, and purity of style,
     or lesson to the heart and mind."&#8212;T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> A<hi rend="smallcaps"

    <p>"The story is vaguely and ineffectively presented. There is little to relieve the repulsive
     character of the whole tone of the play. It dwells pertinaciously and too warmly upon scenes
     which are neither noble, edifying, nor decent."&#8212;B<hi rend="smallcaps">OSTON</hi> D<hi

    <p>"We have but re-echoed the judgment of all competent critics, in saying that Swinburne
     rightfully ranks with the few great poets of this and of other ages. His present work is one of
     the finest artistic efforts which we have ever chanced to encounter. It has more human interest
     than his 'Atalanta in Calydon,' while it is couched in the same vigorous and splendid diction
     and 'is richly dight' with melodious and sweetly magnificent songs. . . . His portraiture is
     one of the amplest, most thoroughly elaborated, and most gorgeously coloured, in the whole wide
     range of British poetry."&#8212;N<hi rend="smallcaps">EW</hi> Y<hi rend="smallcaps">ORK</hi>

    <p>"The sustained and elastic strength of the fourth act, in which the turns and windings of
     Mary's will as Chastelard's death are drawn out&#8212;her perplexity, ruthlessness, contempt
     for a weak man and for a cruel unknightly man, fear of public scorn, remorse for her love,
     vindictive bitterness against Darnley all chasing one another over her mind, with the subtlest
     changes&#8212;make one of the most superb scenes for which a drama of character gives room. We
     feel that the writer is rejoicing in his own skill in unravelling the changeful mysteries of a
     highly complex character. He exults in his mastery over the Queen's rapid passage from one mood
     to another, and in the magic by which he can produce and control her Protean
      transformations."&#8212;S<hi rend="smallcaps">ATURDAY</hi> R<hi rend="smallcaps">EVIEW</hi>,
