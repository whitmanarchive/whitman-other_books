                <p>W<hi rend="smallcaps">ALT</hi> W<hi rend="smallcaps">HITMAN</hi>, second child of
                    Walter Whitman and his wife, Louisa (born Van Velsor), was born May 31, 1819, at
                    West Hills, Long Island, N. Y., where his parents continued to reside till 1823,
                    when they removed with their family to Brooklyn. Here he attended public school
                    till 1831, when he was engaged to tend a lawyer's office, which he subsequently
                    left for a doctor's. He next (in 1833) entered a printing office to learn
                    type-setting, but after some three years gave this up for school-teaching, in
                    which he was occupied for nearly another three years. His next venture was a
                    weekly paper, <hi rend="italic">The Long Islander</hi>, which he started at
                    Huntington, L. I. Before the close of 1840 we find him back in New York working
                    at the press, and employed in desultory journalistic writing. In 1846 he was
                    called to the editorial chair of <hi rend="italic">The Brooklyn Eagle</hi>, a
                    post he held for two years. In 1848 he went to New Orleans to fill a place on
                    the editorial staff of <hi rend="italic">The Crescent</hi>, but after a brief
                    service gave this up to make a tour in the South and South-west. In 1850 he
                    returned to his Brooklyn home and became publisher of <hi rend="italic">The
                    Freeman</hi>, but soon exchanged the pen for the carpenter's adze to engage in
                    house-building and selling.</p>
                <p>In 1855 his sentiments of universal brotherhood first found full public
                    expression by the issue of his "Leaves of Grass," in the form of an unpretending
                    little quarto volume of ninety-five pages. Next year a second edition appeared
                    as a 16mo of 384 pages, and, in 1860, a third edition of 456 pages was issued at
                    Boston.</p>
                <pb xml:id="leaf007v" facs="ppp_vm.00015.jpg" type="verso" n="8"/>
                <p>But a call to which Walt Whitman could not turn a deaf ear summoned him in 1862
                    to different scenes and tasks. It was the call of humanity and patriotism. He
                    proceeded to the seat of war in the South, there to minister to the wounded and
                    sick in the hospitals and on the fields of battle. This work of mercy he
                    continued for three years, and on the close of the war, in 1865, was rewarded by
                    an appointment as a Department Clerk.</p>
                <p>In 1867 he published the fourth edition of "Leaves of Grass," including "Drum
                    Taps," and a fifth edition in 1871. In 1873 he was struck down by paralysis in
                    Washington, and ordered by his physicians to the Atlantic sea-coast. Before
                    reaching this he broke down badly in Philadelphia, and went over to Camden, N.
                    J., to take up his abode with a brother then residing there.</p>
                <p>In 1876 appeared the sixth or Centennial Edition of "Leaves of Grass," along with
                    a companion volume of prose and verse entitled the "Two Rivulets," and, in 1881,
                    the seventh edition of the " Leaves" was issued by Osgood &amp; Co., Boston.</p>
                <p>In 1882 the poet entered into relations with his present publisher, David McKay,
                    who had lately succeeded to the business of Rees, Welsh &amp; Co. In this year
                    Mr. McKay brought out for him the eighth edition of "Leaves of Grass," as also
                    the first edition of "Specimen Days," a prose volume mainly of autobiographical
                    sketches. In 1888, though much disabled physically, Mr. Whitman brought out a
                    new volume of prose and verse, under the title of "November Boughs." In this
                    present year, 1889, he completes his seventieth year, and has issued a memorial
                    edition (limited) of his works complete in one volume. Mr. Whitman has resided
                    for the last fifteen years in Camden, his present residence being 328 Mickle
                    street, in that city. On May 31st his friends entertained him at a banquet on
                    the celebration of his seventieth birthday.</p>

                        <l>Take one tear dropt aside as I go for thought of you,</l>
                        <l>Dead house of loveâhouse of madness and sin, crumbled, crush'd,</l>
                        <l>House of life, erewhile talking and laughingâbut ah, poor house,
                            dead even then,</l>
                        <l>Months, years, an echoing, garnish'd houseâbut dead, dead,

                    balance. And the game of war was not only momentous to him in its issues; it
                    sublimated his spirit by its heroic displays, and tortured him intimately by the
                    spectacle of its horrors. It was a theatre, it was a place of education, it was
                    like a season of religious revival. He watched Lincoln going daily to his work:
                    he studied and fraternized with young soldiery passing to the front; above all,
                    he walked the hospitals, reading the Bible; a patient, helpful, reverend man,
                    full of kind speeches. His memoranda of this period are almost bewildering to
                    read. From one point of view they seem those of a district visitor; from
                    another, they look like the harmless jottings of an artist in the picturesque.
                    More than one woman, on whom I tried the experiment, immediately claimed the
                    writer for a fellow-woman. More than one literary purist might identify him as a
                    shoddy newspaper correspondent without the necessary faculty of style. And yet
                    the story touches home; and if you are of the weeping order of mankind, you will
                    certainly find your eyes fill with tears of which you have no reason to be
                    ashamed. There is only one way to characterize a work of this order, and that is
                    to quote.â<hi rend="ital">R. L. Stevenson, in "Familiar Studies of Men and
                    Books</hi>."]</p>

                <p>D<hi rend="smallcaps">ECORATION</hi> D<hi rend="smallcaps">AY</hi> always brings
                    to my mind pictures of the "hospital part of the drama of
                    1861-<!--en-dash?-->65," as portrayed by Walt Whitman in his "Specimen Days and
                    Collect" (pp. 26-81). These become more and more vivid as the years go by, and
                    reveal more distinctly Walt Whitman <pb xml:id="leaf030v" facs="ppp_vm.00061.jpg" type="verso" n="54"/>himself as the leading figure. We
                    first see him among the camp hospitals in the Army of the Potomac in Falmouth,
                    Va.âopposite Fredericksburgâin December, 1862, talking to soldiers
                    who seem "most susceptible and need it," and writing their home letters,
                    including "love-letters, very tender ones." He was then in perfect physical
                    health, so that it was more in the"simple matter of personal presence and
                    emanating ordinary cheer and magnetism" that he was able to help, than by
                    "medical nursing or delicacies or gifts of money or anything else." Yet with all
                    this physical health, he fortified himself for these visits with "previous rest,
                    the bath, clean clothes, a good meal, and as cheerful an appearance as
                    possible." After a few weeks' experience in Falmouth, we see him in and around
                    Washington, daily visiting hospitals in the Patent Office, Eighth street, H
                    street, Armory Square, and others. Through the aid of friends he is able to give
                    money and necessities to those who need them. He is now giving pocket-diaries
                    and lmanacs; now distributing old pictorial magazines or story papers as well as
                    daily papers, and lending the best books from man to man. He adapts himself to
                    each emergency, however trival. He not only washes and dresses wounds (in some
                    cases the patient is unwilling any one else should do this), but expounds
                    passages from the Bible, and offers prayer at the bedside. "I think I see my
                    friends smiling at this confession," he frankly says, "but I was never more in
                    earnest in my life."</p>

                <p>Some of these hospital sketches reveal a wondrous tenderness and love; as, for
                    instance, the one of the poor youth, "so handsome, athletic, with profuse
                    beautiful shining hair," who as the poet sat looking at him while he lay asleep,
                    "suddenly, without the least start, awakened, opened his eyes, gave me a long
                    steady look, turning his face very slightly to gaze easierâone long, clear
                    silent lookâa slight sighâthen turned back and went into his doze
                    again. Little he <pb xml:id="leaf031r" facs="ppp_vm.00062.jpg" type="recto" n="55"/>knew, poor, death-stricken boy, the heart of the stranger that hovered
                    near." At another time, while spending an afternoon with a suffering, dying
                    soldier, he was asked to read a chapter in the New Testament.</p>

                                opened at the close of one of the first books of the evangelists,
                                and read the chapter describing the latter hours of Christ and the
                                scenes of the Crucifixion. The poor wasted young man asked me to
                                read the following chapter also, how Christ rose again. I read very
                                slowly, for he was feeble. It pleased him very much, yet the tears
                                were in his eyes. He asked me if I enjoyed religion. I said,
                                "Perhaps not, my dear, in the way you mean; and yet, may-be, it is
                                the same thing." He said, "It is my chief reliance." He talked of
                                death, and said he did not fear it. He behaved very manly and
                                affectionate. The kiss I gave him as I was about leaving he returned
                                fourfold. He died a few days later.</p>

                <p>The soldier being a rebel made no difference so long as he needed loving
                    ministrations. For instance, he was tenderly soothing, in his pain a new patient
                    in the hospital, a "very intelligent, well-bred and affectionate" young man,
                    when all at once, turning to him suddenly, the sufferer said: "I hardly think
                    you know who I amâI don't wish to impose upon youâI am a rebel
                    soldier." "I did not know that," was the reply, "but it makes no difference."
                    The poet visited him daily until he died, two weeks later. "I loved him much,"
                    he says, "and always kissed him, as he did me."</p>

                <p>In the hottest days of mid-summer we see this "good gray poet," with his umbrella
                    and fan, on his walks to and from the hospitals. At one time he is carrying
                    "several bottles of blackberry and cherry syrup, good and strong but innocent,"
                    which upon arriving among the soldiers he mingles with ice-water for a
                    refreshing drink, and serves all around. Another hot day he is distributing
                    personally through the wards a large quantity of ice-cream he has bought for a
                    treat. One night after leaving the hospital at ten o'clock, where he had been on
                    self-imposed duty for some five hours, he wandered till long after midnight
                    around the Washington streets.
                    <!--should I be citing the source of all these quotation?-->The "night was
                    sweet," he says, "very clear, sufficiently cool, a voluptuous half-moon slightly
                    golden, the space near it of a transparent blue-gray tinge," while the "sky, the
                    planets, the constellationsâall were so bright, so calm, so expressively
                    silent and soothing after those hospital scenes." This is in contrast to another
                    summer night, when trying to keep cool, sitting by a wounded soldier in the
                    hospital, he hears the home-made music of the young lady urses of the wards, as,
                    "making a charming group, with their handsome, healthy faces, and standing up a
                    little behind them some ten or fifteen of the convalescent soldiers," with books
                    in their hands, they sing, accompanied by the melodeon, the old hymns, "My Days
                    are Gliding Swiftly By," and the like. His sympathy was such that he could
                    honestly say he received as much pleasure sitting there, while these voices
                    "sweetly rose up to the high whitewashed wooden roof, and pleasantly the roof
                    sent it all back," as he had received from the "best Italian compositions
                    expressed by world-famous performers."</p>
                <p>Other pictures linger, such as "Paying the Bounties," "The Deserters," "A Glimpse
                    of War's Hell-Scenes." Besides intercourse with the sick soldiers, we see him
                    having "refreshing" talks with the able-bodied ones whom he meets everywhere
                    about the city. To him there "hangs <pb xml:id="leaf032r" facs="ppp_vm.00064.jpg" type="recto" n="57"/>something majestic about a man who
                    has borne his part in battles, especially if he is quiet regarding it when you
                    desire him to unbosom." He says he is "continually lost at the absence of
                    blowing and blowers among these old-young American militaries." He finds "some
                    man or other who has been in every battle since the war began," from whom he
                    learns something. He doubts whether one can get a "fair idea of what this war
                    practically is, or what genuine America is and her character," without some such
                    experience as that which has come to him. He gives fine praise to the surgeons,
                    nurses and soldiersâ"not a bit of sentimentalism or whining have I seen
                    about a single death-bed in hospital or on the field, but generally impassive
                    indifference."</p>
                <p>The memory of the soldiers' suffering never leaves him. Even while at the dance
                    and supper-rooms for the Inauguration Ball at the Patent Office (1865), where
                    were "beautiful women, perfumes, the violin's sweetness, the polka and the
                    waltz," he could not help thinking of the various scenes enacted there when the
                    crowded mass of the worst wounded of the war was brought in from Second Bull
                    Run, Antietam and Fredericksburg; the "amputation, the blue face, the groan, the
                    glassy eye of the dying, the clotted rag, the odor of wounds and blood and many
                    a mother's son amid strangers passing away untended there, for the crowd was too
                    much for nurse or surgeon." But the sight of the released prisoners of war
                    coming up from the Southern prisons was to him worse than "any sight of
                    battlefields or any collection of wounded, even the bloodiest." There was, as a
                    sample, he says, "one large boat-load of several hundreds brought to Annapolis,
                    and out of the whole number only three individuals were able to walk from the
                    boat. The rest were carried ashore and laid down in one place or another." Can
                    those be <hi rend="italic">men</hi>," he cries in agony, "those little,
                    livid-brown, ash-streaked, monkey-looking dwarfs? Are <pb xml:id="leaf032v" facs="ppp_vm.00065.jpg" type="verso" n="58"/>they really not mummied, dwindled
                    corpses?" As they lay there with a "horrible look in their eyes and skinny lips,
                    often with not enough flesh on the lips to cover their teeth," he felt that no
                    more appalling sight could be seen. But behind all these horrors of war we see
                    the poet's faith in a Higher Power, in a sympathetic letter he wrote to the
                    mother of a soldier whose eyes he had closed in death: "Such things are
                    gloomyâyet there is a textâ'God doeth all things well'âthe
                    meaning of which after due time appears to the soul."</p>
                <p>According to his own testimony, during the three years Walt Whitman was in
                    hospital, camp or field, as "sustainer of spirit and body in some degree, in
                    time of need," he made over six hundred visits or tours, went among from 80,000
                    to 100,000 of the wounded and sick, and distributed as almoner for others many
                    thousands of dollars. With dear or critical cases he generally watched all
                    night, sometimes remaining in the hospital several nights in succession. Those
                    three years, with all their "feverish excitements and physical deprivations and
                    lamentable sights," gave him the "greatest privilege and satisfaction" as well
                    as "most profound lesson of his life." They "aroused, brought out and decided
                    undreamed depths of emotion," and gave him his "most fervent views of the true
                    <hi rend="ital">ensemble</hi> and extent of the States."</p>
                <p>That in all his ministerings he "comprehended all, Northern and Southern,
                    slighted none," makes this little tribute to his loving ministrations
                    particularly appropriate whenever the North and South are joining together in
                    commemorating the heroic dead.</p>
