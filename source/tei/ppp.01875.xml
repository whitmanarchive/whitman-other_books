Autographed and typed inscription for the volume.  The inked mss. contains penciled in revisions that the typescript does not acknowledge, but the latter reads: "And that was war, and such its scene of flitting souls that night, that beauteous night."  This image does not seem to be part of the book proper; perhaps an insert of some sort.

                <div2 type="essay">

                    <p>DURING the Union War I commenced at the close of 1862, and continued steadily
                        through '63, '64 and '65, to visit the sick and wounded of the Army, both on
                        the field and in the Hospitals in and around Washington city. From the first
                        I kept little note-books for impromptu jottings in pencil to refresh my
                        memory of names and circumstances, and what was specially wanted,
                        &amp;c. In these I brief'd cases, persons, sights, occurrences in camp,
                        by the bedside, and not seldom by the corpses of the dead. Of the present
                        Volume most of its pages are <hi rend="italic">verbatim</hi> renderings from
                        such pencillings on the spot. Some were scratch'd down from narratives I
                        heard and itemized while watching, or waiting, or tending somebody amid
                        those scenes. I have perhaps forty such little note-books left, forming a
                        special history of those years, for myself alone, full of associations never
                        to be possibly said or sung. I wish I could convey to the reader the
                        associations that attach to these soil'd and creas'd little livraisons, each
                        composed of a sheet or two of paper, folded small to carry in the pocket,
                        and fasten'd with a pin. I leave them just as I threw them by during the
                        War, blotch'd here and there with more than one blood-stain, hurriedly
                        written, sometimes at the clinique, not seldom amid the excitement of
                        uncertainty, or defeat, or of action, or getting ready for it, or a march.
                        Even these days, at the lapse of many years, I can never turn their tiny
                        leaves, or even take one in my hand, without the actual army sights and hot
                        emotions of the time rushing like a river in full tide through me. Each
                        line, each scrawl, each memorandum, has its history. Some pang of
                        anguish—some tragedy, profounder than ever poet wrote. Out of them
                        arise active and breathing forms. They summon up, even in this silent and
                        vacant room as I write, not only the sinewy regiments and brigades, marching
                        or in camp, but the countless phantoms of those who fell and were hastily
                        buried by wholesale in the battle-pits, or whose dust and bones have been
                        since removed to the National Cemeteries of the land, especially through
                        Virginia and Tennessee. (Not Northern soldiers only—many indeed
                        the Carolinian, Georgian, Alabamian, Louisianian, Virginian—many a
                        Southern face and form, pale, emaciated, with that strange tie of confidence
                        and love between us, welded by sickness, pain of wounds, and little daily,
                        nightly offices of nursing and friendly words and visits, comes up amid the
                        rest, and does</p>

                    <pb facs="ppp.01875.009.jpg" xml:id="leaf004v1" n="4" type="verso"/>

                    <p>not mar, but rounds and gives a finish to the meditation.) Vivid as life,
                        they recall and identify the long Hospital Wards, with their myriad-varied
                        scenes of day or night—the graphic incidents of field or
                        camp—the night before the battle, with many solemn yet cool
                        preparations—the changeful exaltations and depressions of those
                        four years, North and South—the convulsive memories, (let but a
                        word, a broken sentence, serve to recall them)—the clues already
                        quite vanish'd, like some old dream, and yet the list significant enough to
                        soldiers—the scrawl'd, worn slips of paper that came up by bushels
                        from the Southern prisons, Salisbury or Andersonville, by the hands of
                        exchanged prisoners—the clank of crutches on the pavements or
                        floors of Washington, or up and down the stairs of the Paymasters'
                        offices—the Grand Review of homebound veterans at the close of the
                        War, cheerily marching day after day by the President's house, one brigade
                        succeeding another until it seem'd as if they would never end—the
                        strange squads of Southern deserters, (<hi rend="italic">escapees</hi>, I
                        call'd them;)—that little <hi rend="italic">genre</hi> group,
                        unreck'd amid the mighty whirl, I remember passing in a hospital corner, of
                        a dying Irish boy, a Catholic priest, and an improvised altar—Four
                        years compressing centuries of native passion, first-class pictures,
                        tempests of life and death—an inexhaustible mine for the
                        Histories, Drama, Romance and even Philosophy of centuries to
                        come—indeed the Verteber of Poetry and Art, (of personal character
                        too,) for all future America, (far more grand, in my opinion, to the hands
                        capable of it, than Homer's siege of Troy, or the French wars to <choice>
                            <sic>Shakspere</sic>
                            <corr>Shakespeare</corr>
                        </choice>;)—and looking over all, in my remembrance, the tall form
                        of President Lincoln, with his face of deep-cut lines, with the large, kind,
                        canny eyes, the complexion of dark brown, and the tinge of wierd melancholy
                        saturating all.</p>

                    <p>More and more, in my recollections of that period, and through its varied,
                        multitudinous oceans and murky whirls, appear the central resolution and
                        sternness of the bulk of the average American People, animated in Soul by a
                        definite purpose, though sweeping and fluid as some great
                        storm—the Common People, emblemised in thousands of specimens of
                        first-class Heroism, steadily accumulating, (no regiment, no company, hardly
                        a file of men, North or South, the last three years, without such
                        first-class specimens.)</p>

                    <p>I know not how it may have been, or may be, to others—to me the
                        main interest of the War, I found, (and still, on recollection, find,) in
                        those specimens, and in the ambulance, the Hospital, and even the dead on
                        the field. To me, the points illustrating the latent Personal Character and
                        eligibilities of These States, in the two or three millions of American
                        young and middle-aged men, North and South, embodied in the
                        armies—and especially the one-third or one-fourth of</p>

                    <pb facs="ppp.01875.010.jpg" xml:id="leaf005r1" n="5" type="recto"/>

                    <p>their number, stricken by wounds or disease at some time in the course of the
                        contest—were of more significance even than the Political
                        interests involved. (As so much of a Race depends on what it thinks of
                        death, and how it stands personal anguish and sickness. As, in the glints of
                        emotions under emergencies, and the indirect traits and asides in Plutarch,
                        &amp;c., we get far profounder clues to the antique world than all its
                        more formal history.)</p>

                    <p>Future years will never know the seething hell and the black infernal
                        background of countless minor scenes and interiors, (not the few great
                        battles) of the Secession War; and it is best they should not. In the mushy
                        influences of current times the fervid atmosphere and typical events of
                        those years are in danger of being totally forgotten. I have at night
                        watch'd by the side of a sick man in the hospital, one who could not live
                        many hours. I have seen his eyes flash and burn as he recurr'd to the
                        cruelties on his surrender'd brother, and mutilations of the corpse
                        afterward. [See, in the following pages, the incident at
                        Upperville—the seventeen, kill'd as in the description, were left
                        there on the ground. After they dropt dead, no one touch'd
                        them—all were made sure of, however. The carcasses were left for
                        the citizens to bury or not, as they chose.]</p>

                    <p>Such was the War. It was not a quadrille in a ball-room. Its interior history
                        will not only never be written, its practicality, minutia of deeds and
                        passions, will never be even suggested. The actual Soldier of
                        1862–'65, North and South, with all his ways, his incredible
                        dauntlessness, habits, practices, tastes, language, his appetite, rankness,
                        his superb strength and animality, lawless gait, and a hundred unnamed
                        lights and shades of camp—I say, will never be
                        written—perhaps must not and should not be.</p>

                    <p>The present Memoranda may furnish a few stray glimpses into that life, and
                        into those lurid interiors of the period, never to be fully convey'd to the
                        future. For that purpose, and for what goes along with it, the Hospital part
                        of the drama from '61 to '65, deserves indeed to be recorded—(I
                        but suggest it.) Of that many-threaded drama, with its sudden and strange
                        surprises, its confounding of prophecies, its moments of despair, the dread
                        of foreign interference, the interminable campaigns, the bloody battles, the
                        mighty and cumbrous and green armies, the drafts and bounties—the
                        immense money expenditure, like a heavy pouring constant
                        rain—with, over the whole land, the last three years of the
                        struggle, an unending, universal mourning-wail of women, parents,
                        orphans—the marrow of the tragedy concentrated in those
                        Hospitals—(it seem'd sometimes as if the whole interest of the
                        land, North and South, was one vast central Hospital, and all the rest of
                        the affair but flanges)—those forming the Untold and Unwritten

                        1862.—Began my visits among the Camp Hospitals in the Army of the
                        Potomac. Spent a good part of the day in a large brick mansion, on the banks
                        of the Rappahannock, used as a Hospital since the battle—Seems to
                        have receiv'd only the worst cases. Out doors, at the foot of a tree, within
                        ten yards of the front of the house, I notice a heap of amputated feet,
                        legs, arms, hands, &amp;c., a full load for a one-horse cart. Several
                        dead bodies lie near, each cover'd with its brown woollen blanket. In the
                        door-yard, towards the river, are fresh graves, mostly of officers, their
                        names on pieces of barrel-staves or broken board, stuck in the dirt. (Most
                        of these bodies were subsequently taken up and transported North to their
                        friends.)..........The large mansion is quite crowded, upstairs and down,
                        everything impromptu, no system, all bad enough, but I have no doubt the
                        best that can be done; all the wounds pretty bad, some frightful, the men in
                        their old clothes, unclean and bloody. Some of the wounded are rebel
                        soldiers and officers, prisoners. One, a Mississippian—a
                        captain—hit badly in leg, I talk'd with some time; he ask'd me for
                        papers, which I gave him. (I saw him three months afterward in Washington,
                        with his leg amputated, doing well.)..........I went through the rooms,
                        downstairs and up. Some of the men were dying. I had nothing to give at that
                        visit, but wrote a few letters to folks home, mothers, &amp;c. Also
                        talk'd to three or four, who seem'd most susceptible to it, and needing
                        it.</p>

                    <p>(Everything is quiet now, here about Falmouth and the Rappahannock, but there
                        was noise enough a week or so ago. Probably the earth never shook by
                        artificial means, nor the air reverberated, more than on that winter
                        daybreak of eight or nine days since, when Gen. Burnside order'd all the
                        batteries of the army to combine for the bombardment of Fredericksburgh. It
                        was in its way the most magnificent and terrible spectacle, with all the
                        adjunct of sound, throughout the War. The perfect hush of the just-ending
                        night was suddenly broken by the first gun, and in an instant all the
                        thunderers, big and little, were in full chorus, which they kept up without
                        intermission for several hours.)</p>

                        is frozen hard, and there is occasional snow. I go around from one case to
                        another. I do not see that I do much good, but I cannot leave them. Once in
                        a while some youngster holds on to me convulsively, and I do what I can for
                        him; at any rate, stop with him and sit near him for hours, if he wishes

                    <p>Besides the hospitals, I also go occasionally on long tours through the
                        camps, talking with the men, &amp;c. Sometimes at night among the groups
                        around the fires, in their shebang enclosures of bushes. These are curious
                        shows, full of characters and groups. I soon get acquainted anywhere in
                        camp, with officers or men, and am always well used. Sometimes I go down on
                        picket with the regiments I know best.......As to rations, the army here at
                        present seems to be tolerably well supplied, and the men have enough, such
                        as it is, mainly salt pork and hard tack. Most of the regiments lodge in the
                        flimsy little shelter-tents. A few have built themselves huts of logs and
                        mud, with fireplaces.</p>

                        railroad, and so on Government steamer up the Potomac. Many wounded were
                        with us on the cars and boat. The cars were just common platform ones. The
                        railroad journey of ten or twelve miles was made mostly before sunrise. The
                        soldiers guarding the road came out from their tents or shebangs of bushes
                        with rumpled hair and half-awake look. Those on duty were walking their
                        posts, some on banks over us, others down far below the level of the track.
                        I saw large cavalry camps off the road. At Aquia Creek landing were numbers
                        of wounded going North. While I waited some three hours, I went around among
                        them. Several wanted word sent home to parents, brothers, wives,
                        &amp;c., which I did for them, (by mail the next day from Washington.)

                        went pretty thoroughly through Wards F, G, H, and I; some fifty cases in
                        each Ward. In Ward F supplied the men throughout with writing paper and
                        stamp'd envelope each; distributed in small portions, to proper subjects, a
                        large jar of first-rate preserv'd berries, which had been donated to me by a
                        lady—her own cooking. Found several cases I thought good subjects
                        for small sums of money, which I furnish'd. (The wounded men often come up
                        broke, and it helps their spirits to have even the small sum I give them.)

                        reading matter; also, as I thought judicious, tobacco, oranges, apples,

                        D, Fifty-third Pennsylvania, is only sixteen years of age, very bright,
                        courageous boy, left leg amputated below the knee; next bed to him, another

                        amputation of the left leg; gave him a little jar of raspberries; bed No. 1,
                        this Ward, gave a small sum; also to a soldier on crutches, sitting on his
                        bed near.......(I am more and more surprised at the very great proportion of
                        youngsters from fifteen to twenty-one in the army. I afterwards found a

                        is a case of a soldier I found among the crowded cots in the Patent Office.
                        He likes to have some one to talk to, and we will listen to him. He got
                        badly hit in his leg and side at Fredericksburgh that eventful Saturday,
                        13th of December. He lay the succeeding two days and nights helpless on the
                        field, between the city and those grim terraces of batteries; his company
                        and regiment had been compell'd to leave him to his fate. To make matters

                        help himself. At the end of some fifty hours he was brought off, with other

                        the field, among the dead and wounded, for benevolent purposes, came to him
                        in a way he will never forget; treated our soldier kindly, bound up his
                        wounds, cheer'd him, gave him a couple of biscuits, and a drink of whiskey
                        and water; ask'd him if he could eat some beef. This good Secesh, however,
                        did not change our soldier's position, for it might have caused the blood to
                        burst from the wounds, clotted and stagnated. Our soldier is from
                        Pennsylvania; has had a pretty severe time; the wounds proved to be bad
                        ones. But he retains a good heart, and is at present on the gain.........(It
                        is not uncommon for the men to remain on the field this way, one, two, or

                        articles. Wrote letters. Saw and talk'd with two or three members of the

                        a fearful condition, was having some loose splinters of bone taken from the
                        neighborhood of the wound. The operation was long, and one of great
                        pain—yet, after it was well commenced, the soldier bore it in
                        silence. He sat up, propp'd—was much wasted—had lain a
                        long time quiet in one position, (not for days only, but weeks,)—a
                        bloodless, brown-skinn'd face, with eyes full of
                        determination—belong'd to a New York regiment. There was an
                        unusual cluster of surgeons, medical cadets, nurses, &amp;c., around his
                        bed—I</p>

                        fever, pretty bad. In another, by the side of her son—a
                        mother—she told me she had seven children, and this was the
                        youngest. (A fine, kind, healthy, gentle mother, good-looking, not very old,
                        with a cap on her head, and dress'd like home—what a charm it gave
                        to the whole Ward.) I liked the woman nurse Ward E—I noticed how
                        she sat a long time by a poor fellow who just had, that morning, in addition
                        to his other sickness, bad hemmorhage—she gently assisted him,
                        reliev'd him of the blood, holding a cloth to his mouth, as he cough'd it
                        up—he was so weak he could only just turn his head over on the
                        pillow.</p>

                    <p>One young New York man, with a bright, handsome face, had been lying several
                        months from a most disagreeable wound, receiv'd at Bull Run. A bullet had
                        shot him right through the bladder, hitting him front, low in the belly, and
                        coming out back. He had suffer'd much—the water came out of the
                        wound, by slow but steady quantities, for many weeks—so that he
                        lay almost constantly in a sort of puddle—and there were other
                        disagreeable circumstances. He was of good heart, however. At present
                        comparatively comfortable; had a bad throat, was delighted with a stick of

                        at the Patent Office pass away without some mention. A few weeks ago the
                        vast area of the second story of that noblest of Washington buildings, was
                        crowded close with rows of sick, badly wounded and dying soldiers. They were
                        placed in three very large apartments. I went there many times. It was a
                        strange, solemn and, with all its features of suffering and death, a sort of
                        fascinating sight. I go sometimes at night to soothe and relieve particular
                        cases. Two of the immense apartments are fill'd with high and ponderous
                        glass cases, crowded with models in miniature of every kind of utensil,
                        machine or invention, it ever enter'd into the mind of man to conceive; and
                        with curiosities and foreign presents. Between these cases are lateral
                        openings, perhaps eight feet wide, and quite deep, and in these were placed
                        the sick; besides a great long double row of them up and down through the
                        middle of the hall. Many of them were very bad cases, wounds and
                        amputations. Then there was a gallery running above the hall, in which there
                        were beds also. It was, indeed, a curious scene at night, when lit up. The
                        glass cases, the beds, the forms lying there, the gallery above, and the
                        marble pavement under foot—the suffering, and the fortitude to
                        bear it in various degrees—occasionally, from some, the groan that
                        could not be repress'd—sometimes a poor fellow dying, with
                        emaciated face and glassy eye, the nurse by</p>

                        under the moon. To-night took a long look at the President's
                        House—and here is my splurge about it. The white
                        portico—the brilliant gas-light shining—the palace-like
                        portico—the tall, round columns, spotless as snow—the
                        walls also—the tender and soft moonlight, flooding the pale
                        marble, and making peculiar faint languishing shades, not
                        shadows—everywhere too a soft transparent haze, a thin blue
                        moon-lace, hanging in the night in the air—the brilliant and extra
                        plentiful clusters of gas, on and around the facade, columns, portico,
                        &amp;c.—everything so white, so marbly pure and dazzling, yet
                        soft—the White House of future poems, and of dreams and dramas,
                        there in the soft and copious moon—the pure and gorgeous front, in
                        the trees, under the night-lights, under the lustrous flooding moon, full of
                        reality, full of illusion—The forms of the trees, leafless,
                        silent, in trunk and myriad-angles of branches, under the stars and
                        sky—the White House of the land, the White House of the night, and
                        of beauty and silence—sentries at the gates, and by the portico,
                        silent, pacing there in blue overcoats—stopping you not at all,
                        but eyeing you with sharp eyes, whichever way you move.</p>

                        visit I made to the collection of barrack-like one-story edifices, call'd
                        Campbell Hospital, out on the flats, at the end of the then horse-railway
                        route, on Seventh street. There is a long building appropriated to each
                        Ward. Let us go into Ward 6. It contains to-day, I should judge, eighty or a
                        hundred patients, half sick, half wounded. The edifice is nothing but
                        boards, well whitewash'd inside, and the usual slender-framed iron
                        bedsteads, narrow and plain. You walk down the central passage, with a row
                        on either side, their feet toward you, and their heads to the wall. There
                        are fires in large stoves, and the prevailing white of the walls is reliev'd
                        by some ornaments, stars, circles, &amp;c., made of evergreens. The view
                        of the whole edifice and occupants can be taken at once, for there is no
                        partition. You may hear groans, or other sounds of unendurable suffering,
                        from two or three of the iron cots, but in the main there is
                        quiet—almost a painful absence of demonstration; but the pallid
                        face, the dull'd eye, and the moisture on the lip, are demonstration enough.
                        Most of these sick or hurt are evidently young fellows from the country,
                        farmers' sons, and such like. Look at the fine large frames, the bright and
                        broad countenances, and the many yet lingering proofs of strong constitution
                        and physique.</p>

                        and all the cities—largely from the West. Most of them are
                        entirely without friends or acquaintances here—no familiar face,
                        and hardly a word of judicious sympathy or cheer, through their sometimes
                        long and tedious sickness, or the pangs of aggravated wounds.</p>

                        Northford, near New Haven. Though not more than twenty-one, or thereabouts,
                        he has knock'd much around the world, on sea and land, and has seen some
                        fighting on both. When I first saw him he was very sick, with no appetite.
                        He declined offers of money—said he did not need anything. As I
                        was quite anxious to do something, he confess'd that he had a hankering for
                        a good home-made rice pudding—thought he could relish it better
                        than anything. At this time his stomach was very weak. (The doctor, whom I
                        consulted, said nourishment would do him more good than anything; but things
                        in the hospital, though better than usual, revolted him.) I soon procured B.
                        his rice-pudding. A Washington lady, (Mrs. O'C.), hearing his wish, made the
                        pudding herself, and I took it up to him the next day. He subsequently told
                        me he lived upon it for three or four days.......This B. is a good sample of
                        the American Eastern young man—the typical Yankee. I took a fancy
                        to him, and gave him a nice pipe, for a keepsake. He receiv'd afterwards a
                        box of things from home, and nothing would do but I must take dinner with
                        him, which I did, and a very good one it was.</p>

                        arrive from Hooker's command from bloody Chancellorsville. I was down among
                        the first arrivals. The men in charge of them told me the bad cases were yet
                        to come. If that is so I pity them, for these are bad enough. You ought to
                        see the scene of the wounded arriving at the landing here foot of Sixth
                        street, at night. Two boat loads came about half-past seven last night. A
                        little after eight it rain'd a long and violent shower. The poor, pale,
                        helpless soldiers had been debark'd, and lay around on the wharf and
                        neighborhood anywhere. The rain was, probably, grateful to them; at any rate
                        they were exposed to it. The few torches light up the spectacle. All
                        around—on the wharf, on the ground, out on side
                        places—the men are lying on blankets, old quilts, &amp;c.,
                        with bloody rags bound round heads, arms, and legs. The attendants are few,
                        and at night few outsiders also—only a few hard-work'd
                        transportation men and drivers. (The wounded are getting to be common, and
                        people grow callous.) The men, whatever their condition, lie there, and
                        patiently wait till their turn comes to be taken up. Near by, the ambulances
                        are now arriving in clusters, and one after another is call'd to back up and
                        take its load. Extreme cases are sent off on stretchers. The men generally
                        make little or no ado, whatever their sufferings. A few groans that cannot
                        be suppress'd, and occasionally a scream of pain as they lift a man into the
                        ambulance........To day, as I write, hundreds more are expected, and
                        to-morrow and the next day more, and so on for many days. Quite often they

                        an attack sudden and strong by Stonewall Jackson had</p>

                    <p>gain'd a great advantage to the Southern army, and broken our lines, entering
                        us like a wedge, and leaving things in that position at dark. But Hooker at
                        11 at night made a desperate push, drove the Secesh forces back, restored
                        his original lines, and resumed his plans. This night scrimmage was very
                        exciting, and afforded countless strange and fearful pictures. The fighting
                        had been general both at Chancellorsville and northeast at Fredericksburgh.
                        (We hear of some poor fighting, episodes, skedaddling on our part. I think
                        not of it. I think of the fierce bravery, the general rule.) One Corps, the
                        6th, Sedgewick's, fights four dashing and bloody battles in 36 hours,
                        retreating in great jeopardy, losing largely and maintaining itself,
                        fighting with the sternest desperation under all circumstances, getting over
                        the Rappahannock only by the skin of its teeth, yet getting over. It lost
                        many, many brave men, yet it took vengeance, ample vengeance.</p>

                    <p>But it was the tug of Saturday evening, and through the night and Sunday
                        morning, I wanted to make a special note of. It was largely in the woods,
                        and quite a general engagement. The night was very pleasant, at times the
                        moon shining out full and clear, all Nature so calm in itself, the early
                        summer grass so rich, and foliage of the trees—yet there the
                        battle raging, and many good fellows lying helpless, with new accessions to
                        them, and every minute amid the rattle of muskets and crash of cannon, (for
                        there was an artillery contest too,) the red life-blood oozing out from
                        heads or trunks or limbs upon that green and dew-cool grass. The woods take
                        fire, and many of the wounded, unable to move, (especially some of the
                        divisions in the Sixth Corps,) are consumed—quite large spaces are
                        swept over, burning the dead also—some of the men have their hair
                        and beards singed—some, splatches of burns on their faces and
                        hands—others holes burnt in their clothing........The flashes of
                        fire from the cannon, the quick flaring flames and smoke, and the immense
                        roar—the musketry so general, the light nearly bright enough for
                        each side to see one another—the crashing, tramping of
                        men—the yelling—close quarters—we hear the
                        Secesh yells—our men cheer loudly back, especially if Hooker is in
                        sight—hand to hand conflicts, each side stands to it, brave,
                        determin'd as demons, they often charge upon us—a thousand deeds
                        are done worth to write newer greater poems on—and still the woods
                        on fire—still many are not only scorch'd—too many,
                        unable to move, are burn'd to death.........Then the camp of the
                        wounded—O heavens, what scene is this?—is this indeed
                            <hi rend="italic">humanity</hi>—these butchers' shambles?
                        There are several of them. There they lie, in the largest, in an open space
                        in the woods, from 500 to 600 poor fellows—the groans and
                        screams—the odor of blood, mixed with the fresh scent of the
                        night, the</p>

                    <pb facs="ppp.01875.020.jpg" xml:id="leaf010r1" n="15" type="recto"/>

                    <p>grass, the trees—that Slaughter-house!—O well is it their
                        mothers, their sisters cannot see them—cannot conceive, and never
                        conceiv'd, these things.........One man is shot by a shell, both in the arm
                        and leg—both are amputated—there lie the rejected
                        members. Some have their legs blown off—some bullets through the
                        breast—some indescribably horrid wounds in the face or head, all
                        mutilated, sickening, torn, gouged out—some in the
                        abdomen—some mere boys—here is one his face colorless as
                        chalk, lying perfectly still, a bullet has perforated the
                        abdomen—life is ebbing fast, there is no help for him. In the camp
                        of the wounded are many rebels, badly hurt—they take their regular
                        turns with the rest, just the same as any—the surgeons use them
                        just the same.........Such is the camp of the wounded—such a
                        fragment, a reflection afar off of the bloody scene—while over all
                        the clear, large moon comes out at times softly, quietly shining.</p>

                    <p>Such, amid the woods, that scene of flitting souls—amid the crack
                        and crash and yelling sounds—the impalpable perfume of the
                        woods—and yet the pungent, stifling smoke—shed with the
                        radiance of the moon, the round, maternal queen, looking from heaven at
                        intervals so placid—the sky so heavenly—the
                        clear-obscure up there, those buoyant upper oceans—a few large
                        placid stars beyond, coming out and then disappearing—the
                        melancholy, draperied night above, around.......And there, upon the roads,
                        the fields, and in those woods, that contest, never one more desperate in
                        any age or land—both parties now in
                        force—masses—no fancy battle, no semi-play, but fierce
                        and savage demons fighting there—courage and scorn of death the
                        rule, exceptions almost none.</p>

                    <p>What history, again I say, can ever give—for who can know, the mad,
                        determin'd tussle of the armies, in all their separate large and little
                        squads—as this—each steep'd from crown to toe in
                        desperate, mortal purports? Who know the conflict hand-to-hand—the
                        many conflicts in the dark, those shadowy-tangled, flashing-moonbeam'd
                        woods—the writhing groups and squads—hear through the
                        woods the cries, the din, the cracking guns and pistols—the
                        distant cannon—the cheers and calls, and threats and awful music
                        of the oaths—the indiscribable mix—the officers' orders,
                        persuasions, encouragements—the devils fully rous'd in human
                        hearts—the strong word, <hi rend="italic">Charge, men,
                        charge</hi>—the flash of the naked sword, and many a flame and
                        smoke—And still the broken, clear and clouded heaven—and
                        still again the moonlight pouring silvery soft its radiant patches over
                        all?.........Who paint the scene, the sudden partial panic of the afternoon,
                        at dusk? Who paint the irrepressible advance of the Second Division of the
                        Third Corps, under Hooker himself, suddenly order'd up—those
                        rapid-filing phantoms through</p>

                    <pb facs="ppp.01875.021.jpg" xml:id="leaf010v1" n="16" type="verso"/>

                    <p>the woods? Who show what moves there in the shadows, fluid and
                        firm—to save, (and it did save,) the Army's name, perhaps the
                        Nation? And there the veterans hold the field. (Brave Berry falls not
                        yet—but Death has mark'd him—soon he falls.)</p>

                    <p>Of scenes like these, I say, who writes—who e'er can write, the
                        story? Of many a score—aye, thousands, North and South, of unwrit
                        heroes, unknown heroisms, incredible, impromptu, first-class
                        desperations—who tells? No history, ever—No poem sings.
                        nor music sounds, those bravest men of all—those deeds. No formal
                        General's report, nor print, nor book in the library, nor column in the
                        paper, embalms the bravest, North or South, East or West. Unnamed, unknown,
                        remain, and still remain, the bravest soldiers. Our manliest—our
                        boys—our hardy darlings. Indeed no picture gives them. Likely
                        their very names are lost. Likely, the typic one of them, (standing, no
                        doubt, for hundreds, thousands,) crawls aside to some bush-clump, or ferny
                        tuft, on receiving his death-shot—there, sheltering a little
                        while, soaking roots, grass and soil with red blood—the battle
                        advances, retreats, flits from the scene, sweeps by—and there,
                        haply with pain and suffering, (yet less, far less, than is supposed,) the
                        last lethargy winds like a serpent round him—the eyes glaze in
                        death—none recks—Perhaps the burial-squads, in truce, a
                        week afterwards, search not the secluded spot—And there, at last,
                        the Bravest Soldier crumbles in the soil of mother earth, unburied and
                        unknown.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="italic">June</hi> 18.—In one of the Hospitals I find
                        Thomas Haley, Co. M, Fourth New York Cavalry—a regular Irish boy,
                        a fine specimen of youthful physical manliness—shot through the
                        lungs—inevitably dying—came over to this country from
                        Ireland to enlist—has not a single friend or acquaintance
                        here—is sleeping soundly at this moment, (but it is the sleep of
                        death)—has a bullet-hole straight through the lung.......I saw Tom
                        when first brought here, three days since, and didn't suppose he could live
                        twelve hours—(yet he looks well enough in the face to a casual
                        observer.) He lies there with his frame exposed above the waist, all naked,
                        for coolness, a fine built man, the tan not yet bleach'd from his cheeks and
                        neck. It is useless to talk to him, as with his sad hurt, and the stimulants
                        they give him, and the utter strangeness of every object, face, furniture,
                        &amp;c., the poor fellow, even when awake, is like a frighten'd, shy
                        animal. Much of the time he sleeps, or half sleeps. (Sometimes I thought he
                        knew more than he show'd.) I often come and sit by him in perfect silence;
                        he will breathe for ten minutes as softly and evenly as a young babe asleep.
                        Poor youth, so handsome, athletic, with profuse beautiful shining hair. One
                        time as I sat looking at him while he lay asleep, he suddenly, without the
                        least start, awaken'd, open'd his</p>

                    <p>eyes, gave me a long, long steady look, turning his face very slightly to
                        gaze easier—one long, clear silent look—a slight
                        sigh—then turn'd back and went into his doze again. Little he
                        knew, poor death-stricken boy, the heart of the stranger that hover'd
                        near.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="italic">W. H. E., Co. F., Second N. J.</hi>—His disease
                        is pneumonia. He lay sick at the wretched hospital below Aquia Creek, for
                        seven or eight days before brought here. He was detail'd from his regiment
                        to go there and help as nurse; but was soon taken down himself. Is an
                        elderly, sallow-faced, rather gaunt, gray-hair'd man; a widower, with
                        children. He express'd a great desire for good, strong, green tea. An
                        excellent lady, Mrs. W., of Washington, soon sent him a package; also a
                        small sum of money. The doctor said give him the tea at pleasure; it lay on
                        the table by his side, and he used it every day. He slept a great deal;
                        could not talk much, as he grew deaf. Occupied bed 15, Ward I, Armory. (The
                        same lady above, Mrs. W., sent the men a large package of tobacco.)</p>

                    <p>J. G. lies in bed 52, Ward I; is of Co. B, Seventh Pennsylvania. I gave him a
                        small sum of money, some tobacco and envelopes. To a man adjoining, also
                        gave 25 cents; he flush'd in the face, when I offer'd it—refused
                        at first, but as I found he had not a cent, and was very fond of having the
                        daily papers, to read, I prest it on him. He was evidently very grateful,
                        but said little.</p>

                    <p>J. T. L., of Co. F., Ninth New Hampshire, lies in bed 37, Ward I. Is very
                        fond of tobacco. I furnish him some; also with a little money. Has gangrene
                        of the feet, a pretty bad case; will surely have to lose three toes. Is a
                        regular specimen of an old-fashion'd, rude, hearty, New England country man,
                        impressing me with his likeness to that celebrated singed cat, who was
                        better than she look'd.</p>

                    <p>Bed 3, Ward E, Armory, has a great hankering for pickles, something pungent.
                        After consulting the doctor, I gave him a small bottle of horse-radish; also
                        some apples; also a book.........Some of the nurses are excellent. The woman
                        nurse in this Ward I like very much. (Mrs. Wright—a year
                        afterwards I found her in Mansion House Hospital, Alexandri—she is
                        a perfect nurse.)</p>

                    <p>In one bed a young man, Marcus Small, Co. K, Seventh Maine—sick
                        with dysentery and typhoid fever—pretty critical, too—I
                        talk with him often—he thinks he will die—looks like it
                        indeed. I write a letter for him home to East Livermore, Maine—I
                        let him talk to me a little, but not much, advise him to keep very
                        quiet—do most of the talking myself—stay quite a while
                        with him, as he holds to my hand—talk to him in a cheering, but
                        slow, low, and measured manner—talk about his furlough, and going
                        home as soon as he is able to travel.</p>

                    <p>Thomas Lindly, First Pennsylvania Cavalry, shot very badly through the
                        foot—poor young man, suffers horribly, has to be constantly dosed
                        with morphine, his face ashy and glazed, bright young eyes—give
                        him a large handsome apple, tell him to have it roasted in the morning, as
                        he generally feels easier then, and can eat a little breakfast. I write two
                        letters for him.</p>

                    <p>Opposite, an old Quaker lady is sitting by the side of her son, Amer Moore,
                        Second U.S. Artillery—shot in the head two weeks since, very low,
                        quite rational—from hips down, paralyzed—he will surely
                        die. I speak a very few words to him every day and evening—he
                        answers pleasantly—is a handsome fellow—wants
                        nothing—(he told me soon after he came about his home affairs, his

                        seldom in small numbers, but almost always in these long, sad processions.

                        cymbals, playing wild martial tunes—made my heart jump. Then the
                        principal officers, then company after company, with their officers at their
                        heads, making of course the main part of the cavalcade; then a long train of
                        men with led horses, lots of mounted negroes with special
                        horses—and a long string of baggage-wagons, each drawn by four
                        horses—and then a motley rear guard. It was a pronouncedly warlike
                        and gay show. The sabres clank'd, the men look'd young and healthy and
                        strong; the electric tramping of so many horses on the hard road, and the
                        gallant bearing, fine seat, and bright faced appearance of a thousand and
                        more handsome young American men, were so good to see—quite set me
                        up for hours.</p>

                    <p>An hour later another troop went by, smaller in numbers, perhaps three

                        town from north. Several hundred extra horses, some of the mares with colts,
                        trotting along. (Appear'd to be a number of prisoners too.).........How

                        mounted, they ride well, feel good, are young, and gay on the saddle, their
                        blankets in a roll behind them, their sabres clanking at their sides. This
                        noise and movement and the tramp of many horses' hoofs has a curious effect
                        upon one. The bugles play—presently you hear them afar off,

                        ground, a sort of hill, in full view, opposite my window. There are the men

                        with drooping heads and wet sides. They are to be led off presently in
                        groups, to water. The little wall-tents and shelter-tents spring up quickly.

                        Fifty-fourth New York, low with chronic diarrhoea, and a bad wound also. He
                        ask'd me to read to him a chapter in the New Testament. I complied, and
                        ask'd him what I should read. He said: "Make your own
                        choice." I open'd at the close of one of the first books of the
                        Evangelists, and read the chapters describing the latter hours of Christ,
                        and the scenes at the crucifixion. The poor, wasted young man ask'd me to
                        read the following chapter also, how Christ rose again. I read very slowly,
                        for Oscar was feeble. It pleas'd him very much, yet the tears were in his

                        probable." He spoke calmly of his condition. The wound was very
                        bad; discharg'd much. Then the diarrhoea had prostrated him, and I felt that
                        he was even then the same as dying. He behaved very manly and affectionate.
                        The kiss I gave him as I was about leaving he return'd fourfold. He gave me
                        his mother's address, Mrs. Sally D. Wilber, Alleghany Post-office,

                        Chancellorsville, and who has suffer'd much, but who at that moment in the

                        the musquito curtains of the adjoining cots obstructed the sight. I stept
                        round and loop'd them all up, so that he had a clear show, and then sat down
                        again by him, and look'd and listened. The principal singer was a young lady

                        were some ten or fifteen of the convalescent soldiers, young men, nurses,
                        &amp;c., with books in their hands, taking part in the singing. Of
                        course it was not such a performance as the great soloists at the New York

                        scene was, indeed, an impressive one. The men lying up and down the

                        thence,) the cots themselves, with their drapery of white curtains, and the

                        men, and the attitudes they took—the whole was a sight to look
                        around upon again and again. And there, sweetly rose those female voices up
                        to the high, whitewash'd wooden roof, and pleasantly the roof sent it all
                        back again. They sang very well; mostly quaint old songs and declamatory
                        hymns, to fitting tunes. Here, for instance, is one of the songs they

                        excellent place for musical performers,) it was plain to see how it all
                        sooth'd and was grateful to the men. I saw one near me turn over, and bury
                        his face partially in his pillow; he was probably ashamed to be seen with

                    <p><hi rend="italic">Aug.</hi> 12.—I see the President almost every
                        day, as I happen to live where he passes to or from his lodgings out of
                        town. He never sleeps at the White House during the hot season, but has
                        quarters at a healthy location, some three miles north of the city, the
                        Soldiers' Home, a United States military establishment. I saw him this
                        morning about 8 1/2 coming in to business, riding on Vermont avenue, near L
                        street. The sight is a significant one, (and different enough from how and
                        where I first saw him.<ref xml:id="r1" target="n1" n="1"/>)<note xml:id="n1" type="authorial" target="r1" n="1" place="inline">
                            <p>I shall not easily forget the first time I saw Abraham Lincoln. It
                                must have been about the 18th or 19th of February, 1861. It was
                                rather a pleasant spring afternoon, in New York city, as Lincoln
                                arrived there from the West to stop a few hours and then pass on to
                                Washington, to prepare for his inauguration. I saw him in Broadway,
                                near the site of the present Post-office. He had come down, I think,
                                from Canal street, to stop at the Astor House. The broad spaces,
                                sidewalks, and street in the neighborhood, and for some distance,
                                were</p>

                            <p>crowded with solid masses of people, many thousands. The omnibuses
                                and other vehicles had been all turn'd off, leaving an unusual hush
                                in that busy part of the city. Presently two or three shabby hack
                                barouches made their way with some difficulty through the crowd, and
                                drew up at the Astor House entrance. A tall figure step'd out of the
                                centre of these barouches, paus'd leisurely on the sidewalk, look'd
                                up at the dark granite walls and looming architecture of the grand
                                old hotel—then, after a relieving stretch of arms and
                                legs, turn'd round for over a minute to slowly and
                                good—humoredly scan the appearance of the vast and silent
                                crowds—and so, with very moderate pace, and accompanied by
                                a few unknown-looking persons, ascended the portico steps.</p>
                            <p>The figure, the look, the gait, are distinctly impress'd upon me yet;
                                the unusual and uncouth height, the dress of complete black, the
                                stovepipe hat push'd back on the head, the dark-brown complexion,
                                the seam'd and wrinkled yet uncanny-looking face, the black, bushy
                                head of hair, the disproportionately long neck, and the hands held
                                behind as he stood observing the people. All was comparative and
                                ominous silence. The new comer look'd with curiosity upon that
                                immense sea of faces, and the sea of faces return'd the look with
                                similar curiosity. In both there was a dash of something almost
                                comical. Yet there was much anxiety in certain quarters. Cautious
                                persons had fear'd that there would be some outbreak, some mark'd
                                indignity or insult to the President elect on his passage through
                                the city, for he possess'd no personal popularity in New York, and
                                not much political. No such outbreak or insult, however, occur'd.
                                Only the silence of the crowd was very significant to those who were
                                accustom'd to the usual demonstrations of New York in wild,
                                tumultuous hurrahs—the deafening tumults of welcome, and
                                the thunder-shouts of pack'd myriads along the whole line of
                                Broadway, receiving Hungarian Kossuth or Fillibuster Walker.</p>
                        </note>. He always has a</p>

                    <p>company of twenty-five or thirty cavalry, with sabres drawn, and held upright
                        over their shoulders. The party makes no great show in uniforms or horses.
                        Mr. Lincoln, on the saddle, generally rides a good-sized easy-going gray
                        horse, is dress'd in plain black, somewhat rusty and dusty; wears a black
                        stiff hat, and looks about as ordinary in attire, &amp;c., as the
                        commonest man. A Lieutenant, with yellow straps, rides at his left, and
                        following behind, two by two, come the cavalry men in their yellow-striped
                        jackets. They are generally going at a slow trot, as that is the pace set
                        them by the One they wait upon. The sabres and accoutrements clank, and the
                        entirely unornamental <hi rend="italic">cortege</hi> as it trots towards
                        Lafayette square, arouses no sensation, only some curious stranger stops and
                        gazes. I see very plainly ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S dark brown face, with the deep
                        cut lines, the eyes, &amp;c., always to me with a deep latent sadness in
                        the expression. We have got so that we always exchange bows, and very
                        cordial ones.</p>

                    <p>Sometimes the President goes and comes in an open barouche. The cavalry
                        always accompany him, with drawn sabres. Often I notice as he goes out
                        evenings—and sometimes in the morning, when he returns
                        early—he turns off and halts at the large and handsome residence
                        of the Secretary of War, on K street, and holds conference there. If in his
                        barouche, I can see from my window he does not alight, but sits in the
                        vehicle, and Mr. Stanton comes out to attend him. Sometimes one of his sons,
                        a boy of ten or twelve, accompanies him, riding at his right on a pony.</p>

                    <p>Earlier in the summer I occasionally saw the President</p>

                    <pb facs="ppp.01875.029.jpg" xml:id="leaf014v1" n="24" type="verso"/>

                    <p>and his wife, toward the latter part of the afternoon, out in a barouche, on
                        a pleasure ride through the city. Mrs. Lincoln was dress'd in complete
                        black, with a long crape veil. The equipage is of the plainest kind, only
                        two horses, and they nothing extra. They pass'd me once very close, and I
                        saw the President in the face fully, as they were moving slow, and his look,
                        though abstracted, happen'd to be directed steadily in my eye. He bow'd and
                        smiled, but far beneath his smile I noticed well the expression I have
                        alluded to. None of the artists or pictures have caught the deep, though
                        subtle and indirect expression of this man's face. There is something else
                        there. One of the great portrait painters of two or three centuries ago is
                        needed.</p>

                        suffering here from heat. We have had it upon us now eleven days. I go
                        around with an umbrella and a fan. I saw two cases of sun-stroke yesterday,
                        one in Pennsylvania avenue, and another in Seventh street. The City Railroad
                        Company loses some horses every day. Yet Washington is having a livelier
                        August, and is probably putting in a more energetic and satisfactory summer,
                        than ever before during its existence. There is probably more human
                        electricity, more population to make it, more business, more
                        light-heartedness, than ever before. The armies that swiftly circumambiated
                        from Fredericksburgh, march'd, struggled, fought, had out their mighty
                        clinch and hurl at Gettysburgh, wheel'd, have circumambiated again, return'd
                        to their ways, touching us not, either at their going or coming. And
                        Washington feels that she has pass'd the worst; perhaps feels that she is
                        henceforth mistress. So here she sits with her surrounding hills and shores
                        spotted with guns; and is conscious of a character and identity different
                        from what it was five or six short weeks ago, and very considerably
                        pleasanter and prouder.</p>

                        soldiers, you meet everywhere about the city, often superb looking men,
                        though invalids dress'd in worn uniforms, and carrying canes or crutches. I
                        often have talks with them, occasionally quite long and interesting. One,
                        for instance, will have been all through the Peninsula under
                        McClellan—narrates to me the fights, the marches, the strange,

                        untold in any official reports or books or journals. These, indeed, are the
                        things that are genuine and precious. The man was there, has been out two
                        years, has been through a dozen fights, the superfluous flesh of talking is
                        long work'd off him, and now he gives me little but the hard meat and

                        absence of blowing and blowers among these old-young American militaires. I
                        have found some man or another who has been in every battle since the War
                        began, and have talk'd with them about each one, in every part of the United
                        States, and many of the engagements on the rivers and harbors too. I find
                        men here from every State in the Union, without exception. (There are more
                        Southerners, especially Border State men, in the Union army than is
                        generally supposed.) I now doubt whether one can get a fair idea of what
                        this War practically is, or what genuine America is, and her character,
                        without some such experience as this I am having.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="italic">Death of a Wisconsin Officer</hi>.—Another
                        characteristic scene of that dark and bloody 1863, from notes of my visit to
                        Armory Square Hospital, one hot but pleasant summer day........In Ward H we
                        approach the cot of a young Lieutenant of one of the Wisconsin regiments.
                        Tread the bare board floor lightly here, for the pain and panting of death
                        are in this cot! I saw the Lieutenant when he was first brought here from
                        Chancellorsville, and have been with him occasionally from day to day, and
                        night to night. He had been getting along pretty well, till night before
                        last, when a sudden hemorrhage that could not be stopt came upon him, and
                        to-day it still continues at intervals. Notice that water-pail by the side
                        of the bed, with a quantity of blood and bloody pieces of
                        muslin—nearly full; that tells the story. The poor young man is
                        lying panting, struggling painfully for breath, his great dark eyes with a
                        glaze already upon them, and the choking faint but audible in his throat. An
                        attendant sits by him, and will not leave him till the last; yet little or
                        nothing can be done. He will die here in an hour or two without the presence
                        of kith or kin. Meantime the ordinary chat and business of the Ward a little
                        way off goes on indifferently. Some of the inmates are laughing and joking,
                        others are playing checkers or cards, others are reading, &amp;c. (I
                        have noticed through most of the hospitals that as long as there is any
                        chance for a man, no matter how bad he may be, the surgeon and nurses work
                        hard, sometimes with curious tenacity, for his life, doing everything, and
                        keeping somebody by him to execute the doctor's orders, and minister to him
                        every minute night and day.........See that screen there. As you advance
                        through the dusk of early candle-light, a nurse will step forth on tip-toe,
                        and silently but imperiously forbid you to make any noise, or perhaps to

                        recovery and death. Perhaps at this moment the exhausted frame has just
                        fallen into a light sleep that a step might shake. You must retire. The

                        of the destroyer. But when that grip is once firmly fix'd, leaving no hope
                        or chance at all, the surgeon abandons the patient. If it is a case where
                        stimulus is any relief, the nurse gives milk-punch or brandy, or whatever is
                        wanted, <hi rend="italic">ad libitum</hi>. There is no fuss made. Not a bit
                        of sentimentalism or whining have I seen about a single death-bed in

                        as far as any efforts can avail; it is useless to expend emotions or labors.
                        While there is a prospect they strive hard—at least most surgeons

                    <p><hi rend="italic">Aug., Sep., and Oct.,</hi> '63—<hi rend="italic">The Hospitals</hi>.—I am in the habit of going to all, and to
                        Fairfax Seminary, Alexandria, and over Long Bridge to the great Convalescent
                        Camp, &amp;c. The journals publish a regular directory of
                        them—a long list. As a specimen of almost any one of the larger of
                        these Hospitals, fancy to yourself a space of three to twenty acres of
                        ground, on which are group'd ten or twelve very large wooden barracks, with,
                        perhaps, a dozen or twenty, and sometimes more than that number, of small
                        buildings, capable altogether of accommodating from five hundred to a
                        thousand or fifteen hundred persons. Sometimes these wooden barracks or
                        Wards, each of them, perhaps, from a hundred to a hundred and fifty feet
                        long, are ranged in a straight row, evenly fronting the street; others are
                        plann'd so as to form an immense V; and others again are ranged around a
                        hollow square. They make altogether a huge cluster, with the additional
                        tents, extra wards for contagious diseases, guard-houses, sutler's stores,
                        chaplain's house, &amp;c. In the middle will probably be an edifice
                        devoted to the offices of the Surgeon in Charge, and the Ward Surgeons,
                        principal attaches, clerks, &amp;c. Then around this centre radiate or
                        are gather'd the Wards for the wounded and sick. The Wards are either
                        letter'd alphabetically, Ward G, Ward K, or else numerically, 1, 2, 3,
                        &amp;c. Each has its Ward Surgeon and corps of nurses. Of course, there
                        is, in the aggregate, quite a muster of employes, and over all the Surgeon
                        in Charge.</p>

                    <p>The newspaper reader off through the agricultural regions, East or West, sees
                        frequent allusions to these Hospitals, but has probably no clear idea of
                        them. Here in Washington, when they are all fill'd, (as they have been
                        already several times,) they contain a population more numerous in itself
                        than the whole of the Washington of ten or fifteen years ago. Within sight
                        of the Capitol, as I write, are some fifty or sixty such collections or
                        camps, at times holding from fifty to seventy thousand men. Looking from any
                        eminence and studying the topography in my rambles, I use</p>

                    <p>them as landmarks. Through the rich August verdure of the trees see that
                        white group of buildings off yonder in the outskirts; then another cluster
                        half a mile to the left of the first; then another a mile to the right, and
                        another a mile beyond, and still another between us and the first. Indeed,
                        we can hardly look in any direction but these grim clusters are dotting the
                        beautiful landscape and environs. That little town, as you might suppose it,
                        off there on the brow of a hill, is indeed a town, but of wounds, sickness,
                        and death. It is Finley Hospital, northeast of the city, on Kendall Green,
                        as it used to be call'd. That other is Campbell Hospital. Both are large
                        establishments. I have known these two alone to have from two thousand to
                        twenty-five hundred inmates. Then there is Carver Hospital, larger still, a
                        wall'd and military city regularly laid out, and guarded by squads of
                        sentries. Again, off east, Lincoln Hospital, a still larger one; and half a
                        mile further Emory Hospital. Still sweeping the eye around down the river
                        toward Alexandria, we see, to the right, the locality where the Convalescent
                        Camp stands, with its five, eight, or sometimes ten thousand inmates. Even
                        all these are but a portion. The Harewood, Mount Pleasant, Armory Square,
                        Judiciary Hospitals, are some of the rest, already mention'd, and all of
                        them large collections.</p>

                        force southward from camp as if intending business. They went to the

                        returning. I talked with some of the men. As usual I found them full of
                        gayety, endurance, and many fine little outshows, the signs of the most

                        usual burdens, overcoats, knapsacks, guns and blankets. Along and along they
                        filed by me, with often a laugh, a song, a cheerful word, but never once a
                        murmur. It may have been odd, but I never before so realized the majesty and

                        awe. The strong ranks moved neither fast nor slow. They had march'd seven or
                        eight miles already through the slipping, unctious mud. The brave First
                        Corps stopt here. The equally brave Third Corps moved on to Brandy

                        myself rous'd to surprise and admiration. What capacity for products,
                        improvements, human life, nourishment and expansion! Everywhere that I have
                        been in the Old Dominion, (the subtle mockery of that title now!) such
                        thoughts have fill'd me. The soil is yet far above the average of any of the
                        northern States. And how full of breadth is the scenery, everywhere with
                        distant mountains, everywhere convenient rivers. Even yet prodigal in forest
                        woods, and surely eligible for all the fruits, orchards, and flowers. The
                        skies and atmosphere most luscious, as I feel certain, from more than a
                        year's residence in the State, and movements hither and yon. I should say
                        very healthy, as a general thing. Then a rich and elastic quality, by night
                        and by day. The sun rejoices in his strength, dazzling and burning, and yet,
                        to me, never unpleasantly weakening. It is not the panting tropical heat,
                        but invigorates. The north tempers it. The nights are often unsurpassable.
                        Last evening (Feb. 8,) I saw the first of the new moon, the old moon clear
                        along with it; the sky and air so clear, such transparent hues of color, it
                        seem'd to me I had never really seen the new moon before. It was the
                        thinnest cut crescent possible. It hung delicate just above the sulky shadow
                        of the Blue Mountains. Ah, if it might prove an omen and good prophecy for
                        this unhappy State.</p>

                        interleav'd with blank paper. For reading I generally have some old

                        Also the morning or evening papers of the day. The best books I do not give,

                            Oct.</hi> 24.—Saw a large squad of our own deserters, (over
                        300) surrounded with a strong cordon of arm'd guards, marching along
                        Pennsylvania avenue. The most motley collection I ever saw, all sorts of
                        rig, all sorts of hats and caps, many fine-looking young fellows, some of
                        them shame-faced, some sickly, most of them dirty, shirts very dirty and
                        long worn, &amp;c. They tramp'd along without order, a huge huddling
                        mass, not in ranks. I saw some of the spectators laughing, but I felt like
                        anything else but laughing.</p>

                    <p>These deserters are far more numerous than would be thought. Almost every day
                        I see squads of them, sometimes two or three at a time, with a small guard;
                        sometimes ten or twelve, under a larger one. (I hear that desertions from
                        the army now in the field have often averaged 10,000 a month. One of the
                        commonest sights in Washington is a squad of deserters. I often think it
                        curious that the military and civil operations do not clash, but they never
                        do here.)</p>

                    <p><hi rend="italic">A Glimpse of War's Hell-Scenes.</hi>—In one of
                        the late movements of our troops in the Valley, (near Upperville, I think,)
                        a strong force of Moseby's mounted guerillas attack'd a train of wounded,
                        and the guard of cavalry convoying them. The ambulances contain'd about 60
                        wounded, quite a number of them officers of rank. The rebels were in
                        strength, and the capture of the train and its partial guard after a short
                        snap was effectually accomplish'd.</p>

                    <p>No sooner had our men surrender'd, the rebels instantly commenced robbing the
                        train, and murdering their prisoners, even the wounded. Here is the scene,
                        or a sample of it, ten minutes after. Among the wounded officers in the
                        ambulances were one, a Lieutenant of regulars, and another of higher rank.
                        These two were dragg'd out on the ground on their backs, and were now
                        surrounded by the guerillas, a demoniac crowd, each member of which was
                        stabbing them in different parts of their bodies. One of the officers had
                        his feet pinn'd firmly to the ground by bayonets stuck through them and
                        thrust into the ground. These two officers, as afterwards found on
                        examination, had receiv'd about twenty such thrusts, some of them through
                        the mouth, face, &amp;c. The wounded had all been dragg'd (to give a
                        better chance also for plunder,) out of their wagons; some had been
                        effectually dispatch'd, and their bodies lying there lifeless and bloody.
                        Others, not yet dead, but horribly mutilated, were moaning or groaning. Of
                        our men who surrender'd, most had been thus maim'd or slaughter'd.</p>

                    <p>At this instant a force of our cavalry, who had been following the train at
                        some interval, charged suddenly upon the Secesh captors, who proceeded at
                        once to make the best escape they could. Most of them got away, but we
                        gobbled two officers and seventeen men, as it were in the very acts just
                        described. The sight was one which admitted of little discussion, as may be
                        imagined. The seventeen captured men and two officers were put under guard
                        for the night, but it was decided there and then that they should die.</p>

                    <p>The next morning the two officers were taken in the town, separate places,
                        put in the centre of the street, and shot. The seventeen men were taken to
                        an open ground, a little to one side. They were placed in a hollow square,
                        encompass'd by two of our cavalry regiments, one of which regiments had
                        three days before found the bloody corpses of three of their men hamstrung
                        and hung up by the heels to limbs of trees by Moseby's guerillas, and the
                        other had not long before had twelve men, after surrendering, shot and then
                        hung by the neck to limbs of trees, and jeering inscriptions pinn'd to the
                        breast of one of the corpses, who had been a sergeant. Those three, and
                        those twelve, had been found, I say, by these environing regiments. Now,
                        with revolvers, they form'd the grim cordon of their seventeen prisoners.
                        The latter were placed</p>

                    <p>in the midst of the hollow square, were unfasten'd, and the ironical remark
                        made to them that they were now to be given "a chance for
                        themselves." A few ran for it. But what use? From every side the
                        deadly pills came. In a few minutes the seventeen corpses strew'd the hollow
                        square.......I was curious to know whether some of the Union soldiers, some
                        few, (some one or two at least of the youngsters,) did not abstain from
                        shooting on the helpless men. Not one. There was no exultation, very little
                        said; almost nothing, yet every man there contributed his shot.</p>

                    <p>(Multiply the above by scores, aye hundreds—varify it in all the
                        forms that different circumstances, individuals, places, &amp;c., could
                        afford—light it with every lurid passion, the wolf's, the lion's
                        lapping thirst for blood, the passionate, boiling volcanoes of human revenge
                        for comrades, brothers slain—with the light of burning farms, and
                        heaps of smutting, smouldering black embers—and in the human heart
                        everywhere black, worse embers—and you have an inkling of this

                    <p><hi rend="italic">Gifts</hi>—<hi rend="italic">Money</hi>—<hi rend="italic">Discrimination.</hi>—As a very large proportion of the wounded
                        still come up from the front without a cent of money in their pockets, I
                        soon discover'd that it was about the best thing I could do to raise their
                        spirits, and show them that somebody cared for them, and practically felt a
                        fatherly or brotherly interest in them, to give them small sums, in such
                        cases, using tact and discretion about it. I am regularly supplied with
                        funds for this purpose by good women and men in Boston, Salem, Providence,
                        Brooklyn, and New York. I provide myself with quantity of bright, new
                        ten-cent and five-cent bills, and, when I think it incumbent, I give 25 or
                        30 cents, or perhaps 50 cents, and occasionally a still larger sum to some
                        particular case.</p>

                    <p>As I have recurr'd to this subject several times, I may take opportunity to
                        ventilate and sum up the financial question. My supplies, altogether
                        voluntary, mostly confidential, often seeming quite Providential, were
                        numerous and varied. For instance, there were two distant and wealthy
                        ladies, sisters, who sent regularly, for two years, quite heavy sums,
                        enjoining that their names should be kept secret. The same delicacy was
                        indeed a frequent condition. From several I had <hi rend="italic">carte
                            blanche.</hi> Many were entire strangers. From these sources, during
                        from two to three years, in the manner described, in the Hospitals, I
                        bestow'd, as almoner for others, many, many thousands of dollars. I learn'd
                        one thing conclusively—that beneath all the ostensible greed and
                        heartlessness of our times there is no end to the generous benevolence of
                        men and women in the United States, when once sure of their object. Another
                        thing became clear to me—while <hi rend="italic">cash</hi> is not
                        amiss to bring up the rear, tact and magnetic sympathy and unction are, and
                        ever will be, sovereign still.</p>

                        the past fifteen months. He belonged to Company A, One Hundred and First New
                        York, and was shot through the lower region of the abdomen at second Bull
                        Run, August, '62. One scene at his bedside will suffice for the agonies of
                        nearly two years. The bladder had been perforated by a bullet going entirely
                        through him. Not long since I sat a good part of the morning by his bedside,
                        Ward E, Armory Square. The water ran out of his eyes from the intense pain,
                        and the muscles of his face were distorted, but he utter'd nothing except a
                        low groan now and then. Hot moist cloths were applied, and reliev'd him
                        somewhat. Poor Mahay, a mere boy in age, but old in misfortune. He never
                        knew the love of parents, was placed in his infancy in one of the New York
                        charitable institutions, and subsequently bound out to a tyrannical master
                        in Sullivan County, (the scars of whose cowhide and club remain'd yet on his
                        back.) His wound here was a most disagreeable one, for he was a gentle,
                        cleanly and affectionate boy. He found friends in his hospital life, and,
                        indeed, was a universal favorite. He had quite a funeral ceremony.</p>

                        never ceas'd to find the best young men, and the hardest and most

                        be in the papers of the North, this is the actual fact. No thorough previous

                    <p><hi rend="italic">Boys in the Army.</hi>—As I walk'd home about
                        sunset, I saw in Fourteenth street a very young soldier, thinly clad,
                        standing near the house I was about to enter. I stopt a moment in front of
                        the door and call'd him to me. I knew that an old Tennessee Union regiment,
                        and also an Indiana regiment, were temporarily stopping in new barracks,
                        near Fourteenth street. This boy I found belonged to the Tennessee regiment.
                        But I could hardly believe he carried a musket. He was but 15 years old, yet
                        had been twelve months a soldier, and had borne his part in several battles,
                        even historic ones.......I ask'd him if he did not suffer from the cold and
                        if he had no overcoat. No, he did not suffer from cold, and had no overcoat,
                        but could draw one whenever he wish'd. His father was dead, and his mother
                        living in some part of East Tennessee; all the men were from that part of
                        the country.</p>

                    <p>The next forenoon I saw the Tennessee and Indiana regiments marching down the
                        Avenue. My boy was with the former, stepping along with the rest. There were
                        many other boys no older. I stood and watch'd them as they tramp'd along
                        with slow, strong, heavy, regular steps. There did not appear to be a man
                        over 30 years of age, and a large proportion were from 15 to perhaps 22 or
                        23. They had all the look of veterans, worn, stain'd, impassive, and a
                        certain unbent, lounging gait, carrying in addition to their regular arms
                        and knapsacks, frequently a frying-pan, broom, &amp;c. They were all of
                        pleasant, even handsome physiognomy; no refinement, nor blanch'd with
                        intellect, but as my eye pick'd them, moving along, rank by rank, there did
                        not seem to be a single repulsive, brutal or markedly stupid face among
                        them.</p>

                        Then it remains to be distinctly said that few or no young ladies, under the
                        irresistible conventions of society, answer the practical requirements of
                        nurses for soldiers. Middle-aged or healthy and good condition'd elderly
                        women, mothers of children, are always best. Many of the wounded must be
                        handled. A hundred things which cannot be gainsay'd, must occur and must be
                        done. The presence of a good middle-aged or elderly woman, the magnetic
                        touch of hands, the expressive features of the mother, the silent soothing
                        of her presence, her words, her knowledge and privileges arrived at only
                        through having had children, are precious and final qualifications. (Mrs. H.
                        J. Wright, of Mansion House Hospital, Alexandria, is one of those good
                        nurses. I have known her for over two years in her labors of love.) It is a
                        natural faculty that is required; it is not merely having a genteel young
                        woman at a table in a Ward. One of the finest nurses I met was a red-faced
                        illiterate old Irish woman; I have seen her take the poor wasted naked boys
                        so tenderly up in her arms. There are plenty of excellent clean old black
                        women that would make tip-top nurses.</p>

                        call'd, but the usual meaning of the word does not apply to them,) passing
                        along the Avenue to-day. There were nearly 200 of them, come up yesterday by
                        boat from James River. I stood and watch'd them as they pass'd along in a
                        slow, tired, worn sort of way. There was a curiously large proportion of
                        light-hair'd, blonde, light gray-eyed young men among them. Their costumes
                        had a dirt-stain'd uniformity; most had been originally gray; some among
                        them had articles of our uniform, pants on one, vest or coat on another. I
                        think they were mostly Georgia and North Carolina boys. They excited little
                        or no attention. As I stood quite close to them, several good looking enough
                        American youths, (but O what a tale of misery their appearance told,) nodded
                        or just spoke to me, without doubt divining pity and fatherliness out of my
                        face, for my heart was full enough of it. Several of the couples trudged
                        along with their arms about each other, some probably brothers; it seem'd as
                        if they were afraid they might some how get separated. They nearly all
                        look'd what one might call simple, yet intelligent enough, too. Some had
                        pieces of old carpet, some blankets, and others old bags around their
                        shoulders, and some of them here and there had fine faces, still it was a

                        complacently standing eating some bread and meat. He appear'd contented

                        headquarters of the city, not far from the President's house, I stopt to
                        talk with some of the crowd of escapees who were lounging there. In
                        appearance they were the same as previously mention'd. Two of them, one
                        about 17, and the other perhaps 25 or 6, I talk'd with some time. They were
                        from North Carolina, born and rais'd there, and had folks there. The elder
                        had been in the rebel service four years. He was first conscripted for two
                        years. He was then kept arbitrarily in the ranks. This is the case with a
                        large proportion of the Secession army. There is no shame in leaving such
                        service—was nothing downcast in these young men's manners. The
                        younger had been soldiering about a year. He was conscripted. There were six
                        brothers (all the boys of the family) in the army, part of them as
                        conscripts, part as volunteers. Three had been kill'd. One had escaped about
                        four months ago, and now this one had got away. He was a pleasant and
                        well-talking lad, with the peculiar North Carolina idiom, (not at all
                        disagreeable to my ears.) He and the elder one were of the same company, and
                        escaped together—and wish'd to remain together. They thought of
                        getting transportation away to Missouri, and working there; but were not
                        sure it was judicious. I advised them rather to go to some of the directly
                        northern States, and get farm work for the present</p>

                        dark-brown eyes, very fine—didn't know what to make of
                        me—told me at last he wanted much to get some clean underclothes,
                        and a pair of decent pants. Didn't care about coat or hat fixings. Wanted a
                        chance to wash himself well, and put on the underclothes. I had the very
                        great pleasure of helping him to accomplish all those wholesome designs.</p>

                        were both in session till very late. I look'd in upon them, but only a few
                        moments; they were hard at work on tax and appropriation bills. I wander'd
                        through the long and rich corridors and apartments under the Senate; an old
                        habit of mine, former winters, and now more satisfaction than ever. Not many

                        I took a notion to go—was in the rush inside with the
                        crowd—surged along the passage-ways, the Blue and other rooms, and
                        through the great East room, (upholster'd like a stage parlor.) Crowds of
                        country people, some very funny. Fine music from the Marine Band, off in a
                        side place.......I saw Mr. Lincoln, <choice>

                        usual, and on a larger scale than usual—whether this, or no, it is
                        certain that there is now, and has been for twenty months or more on this
                        American Continent North, many a remarkable, many an unprecedented
                        expression of the subtile world of air above us and around us. There, since
                        this War, and the wide and deep National agitation, strange analogies,
                        different combinations, a different sunlight, or absence of it; different
                        products even out of the ground. After every great battle, a great storm.
                        Even civic events, the same. On Saturday last, a forenoon like whirling
                        demons, dark, with slanting rain, full of rage; and then the afternoon, so
                        calm, so bathed with flooding splendor from heaven's most excellent sun,
                        with atmosphere of sweetness; so clear, it show'd the stars, long, long
                        before they were due. As the President came out on the Capitol portico, a
                        curious little white cloud, the only one in that part of the sky, appear'd
                        like a hovering bird, right over him.</p>

                    <p>Indeed, the heavens, the elements, all the meteorological influences, have
                        run riot for weeks past. Such caprices, abruptest alternation of frowns and
                        beauty, I never knew. It is a common remark that (as last Summer was
                        different in its spells of intense heat from any preceding it,) the Winter
                        just completed has been without parallel. It has remain'd so down to the
                        hour I am writing. Much of the day-time of the past month was sulky, with
                        leaden heaviness, fog, interstices of bitter cold, and some insane storms.
                        But there have been samples of another description. Nor earth,</p>

                    <p>nor sky ever knew spectacles of superber beauty than some of the nights have
                        lately been here. The western star, Venus, in the earlier hours of evening,
                        has never been so large, so clear; it seems as if it told something, as if
                        it held rapport indulgent with humanity, with us Americans. Five or six
                        nights since, it hung close by the moon, then a little past its first
                        quarter. The star was wonderful, the moon like a young mother. The sky, dark
                        blue, the transparent night, the planets, the moderate west wind, the
                        elastic temperature, the unsurpassable miracle of that great star, and the
                        young and swelling moon swimming in the west, suffused the soul. Then I
                        heard, slow and clear, the deliberate notes of a bugle come up out of the
                        silence, sounding so good through the night's mystery, no hurry, but firm
                        and faithful, floating along, rising, falling leisurely, with here and there
                        a long-drawn note; the bugle, well play'd, sounding tattoo, in one of the
                        army Hospitals near here, where the wounded (some of them personally so dear
                        to me,) are lying in their cots, and many a sick boy come down to the war
                        from Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, and the rest.</p>

                        Saturday last, (March 4th.) The day just dawn'd, but in half-darkness,
                        everything dim, leaden, and soaking. In that dim light the members nervous
                        from long drawn duty, exhausted, some asleep, and many half asleep. The
                        gas-light, mix'd with the dingy day-break, produced an unearthly effect. The
                        poor little sleepy, stumbling pages, the smell of the Hall, the members with
                        heads leaning on their desks asleep, the sounds of the voices speaking, with
                        unusual intonations—the general moral atmosphere also of the close
                        of this important session—the strong hope that the War is
                        approaching its close—the tantalizing dread lest the hope may be a
                        false one—the grandeur of the Hall itself, with its effect of vast
                        shadows up toward the panels and spaces over the galleries—all
                        made a mark'd combination.</p>

                    <p>In the midst of this, with the suddenness of a thunderbolt, burst one of the
                        most angry and crashing storms of rain and wind ever heard. It beat like a
                        deluge on the heavy glass roof of the Hall, and the wind literally howl'd
                        and roar'd. For a moment, (and no wonder,) the nervous and sleeping
                        Representatives were thrown into confusion. The slumberers awaked with fear,
                        some started for the doors, some look'd up with blanch'd cheeks and lips to
                        the roof, and the little pages began to cry; it was a scene! But it was over
                        almost as soon as the drowsied men were actually awake. They recover'd
                        themselves; the storm raged on, beating, dashing, and with loud noises at
                        times. But the House went ahead with its business then, I think, as calmly
                        and with as much deliberation as at any time in its career. Perhaps the
                        shock did it good. (One is not without impression, after all, amid these
                        members of Congress, of both the Houses, that if the flat and selfish
                        routine of their duties should ever be broken in upon by some great
                        emergency involving real danger, and calling for first-class personal
                        qualities, those qualities would be found generally forthcoming, and from
                        men not now credited with them.)</p>

                        Steadman, at night. The Fort was surprised at dead of night. Suddenly
                        awaken'd from their sleep, and rushing from their tents, Harlowe, with
                        others, found himself in the hands of the Secesh—they demanded his

                        to fight on, and himself attempted to do so. The rebel Captain then shot
                        him—but at the same instant he shot the Captain. Both fell
                        together, mortally wounded. Harlowe died almost instantly. (The rebels were
                        driven out in a very short time.) The body was buried next day, but soon
                        taken up and sent home, (Plymouth Co., Mass.).......Harlowe was only 22
                        years of age—was a tall, slim, dark-hair'd, blue-eyed young

                        is the way he met his death, after four years campaign. He was in the Seven

                        old officer of the regiment will bear that testimony.......Though so young,
                        and in a common rank, he had a spirit as resolute and brave as any hero in

                        14, 1865, seems to have been a pleasant one throughout the whole

                        breaking-down of Secessionism—we almost doubted our own senses!
                        Lee had capitulated beneath the apple-tree of Appomattax. The other armies,

                        of plan, like a shaft of pure light—of rightful rule—of
                        God?.......So the day, as I say, was propitious. Early herbage, early
                        flowers, were out. (I remember where I was stopping at the time, the season
                        being advanced, there were many lilacs in full bloom. By one of those
                        caprices that enter and give tinge to events without being at all a part of

                        real history's stage, through centuries, should sit there and be so

                        action or business excitements and cares during the day, as it makes not the
                        slightest call on either the moral, emotional, esthetic, or spiritual
                        nature—a piece, ('Our American Cousin,') in which, among other
                        characters, so call'd, a Yankee, certainly such a one as was never seen, or
                        the least like it ever seen, in North America, is introduced in England,
                        with a varied fol-de-rol of talk, plot, scenery, and such phantasmagoria as
                        goes to make up a modern popular drama—had progress'd through
                        perhaps a couple of its acts, when in the midst of this comedy, or tragedy,
                        or non-such, or whatever it is to be call'd, and to off-set it or finish it
                        out, as if in Nature's and the Great Muse's mockery of those poor mimes,
                        comes interpolated that Scene, not really or exactly to be described at all,
                        (for on the many hundreds who were there it seems to this hour to have left
                        little but a passing blur, a dream, a blotch)—and yet partially to
                        be described as I now proceed to give it.......There is a scene in the play
                        representing a modern parlor, in which two unprecedented English ladies are
                        inform'd by the unprecedented and impossible Yankee that he is not a man of
                        fortune, and therefore undesirable for marriage-catching purposes; after
                        which, the comments being finish'd, the dramatic trio make exit, leaving the
                        stage clear for a moment. There was a pause, a hush as it were. At this
                        period came the murder of Abraham Lincoln. Great as that was, with all its
                        manifold train, circling round it, and stretching into the future for many a
                        century, in the politics, history, art, &amp;c., of the New World, in
                        point of fact the main thing, the actual murder, transpired with the quiet
                        and simplicity of any commonest occurrence—the bursting of a bud
                        or pod in the growth of vegetation, for instance. Through the general hum
                        following the stage pause, with the change of positions, &amp;c., came
                        the muffled sound of a pistol shot, which not one hundredth part of the
                        audience heard at the time—and yet a moment's
                        hush—somehow, surely a vague startled thrill—and then,
                        through</p>

                    <p>the ornamented, draperied, starr'd and striped space-way of the President's
                        box, a sudden figure, a man raises himself with hands and feet, stands a
                        moment on the railing, leaps below to the stage, (a distance of perhaps
                        fourteen or fifteen feet,) falls out of position, catching his boot-heel in
                        the copious drapery, (the American flag,) falls on one knee, quickly
                        recovers himself, rises as if nothing had happen'd, (he really sprains his
                        ankle, but unfelt then,)—and so the figure, Booth, the murderer,
                        dress'd in plain black broadcloth, bare-headed, with a full head of glossy,
                        raven hair, and his eyes like some mad animal's flashing with light and
                        resolution, yet with a certain strange calmness, holds aloft in one hand a
                        large knife—walks along not much back from the
                        footlights—turns fully toward the audience his face of statuesque
                        beauty, lit by those basilisk eyes, flashing with desperation, perhaps
                        insanity—launches out in a firm and steady voice the words, <hi rend="italic">Sic semper tyrannis</hi>—and then walks with
                        neither slow nor very rapid pace diagonally across to the back of the stage,
                        and disappears.......(Had not all this terrible scene—making the
                        mimic ones preposterous—had it not all been rehears'd, in blank,
                        by Booth, beforehand?)</p>

                    <p>A moment's hush, incredulous—a scream—the cry of <hi rend="italic">Murder</hi>—Mrs. Lincoln leaning out of the box,
                        with ashy cheeks and lips, with involuntary cry, pointing to the retreating
                        figure, <hi rend="italic">He has kill'd the President</hi>.......And still a
                        moment's strange, incredulous suspense—and then the
                        deluge!—then that mixture of horror, noises,
                        uncertainty—(the sound, somewhere back, of a horse's hoofs
                        clattering with speed)—the people burst through chairs and
                        railings, and break them up—that noise adds to the queerness of
                        the scene—there is inextricable confusion and
                        terror—women faint—quite feeble persons fall, and are
                        trampled on—many cries of agony are heard—the broad
                        stage suddenly fills to suffocation with a dense and motley crowd, like some
                        horrible carnival—the audience rush generally upon it—at
                        least the strong men do—the actors and actresses are all there in
                        their play-costumes and painted faces, with mortal fright showing through
                        the rouge, some trembling—some in tears—the screams and
                        calls, confused talk—redoubled, trebled—two or three
                        manage to pass up water from the stage to the President's
                        box—others try to clamber up—&amp;c., &amp;c.,
                        &amp;c.</p>

                    <p>In the midst of all this, the soldiers of the President's Guard, with others,
                        suddenly drawn to the scene, burst in—(some two hundred
                        altogether)—they storm the house, through all the tiers,
                        especially the upper ones, inflamed with fury, literally charging the
                        audience with fix'd bayonets, muskets and pistols, shouting <hi rend="italic">Clear out! clear out! you sons
                        of</hi>—.......Such the wild scene, or a suggestion of it rather,
                        inside the play-house that night.</p>

                    <p>Outside, too, in the atmosphere of shock and craze, crowds</p>

                    <pb facs="ppp.01875.054.jpg" xml:id="leaf027r1" n="49" type="recto"/>

                    <p>of people, fill'd with frenzy, ready to seize any outlet for it, come near
                        committing murder several times on innocent individuals. One such case was
                        especially exciting. The infuriated crowd, through some chance, got started
                        against one man, either for words he utter'd, or perhaps without any cause
                        at all, and were proceeding at once to actually hang him on a neighboring
                        lamp post, when he was rescued by a few heroic policemen, who placed him in
                        their midst and fought their way slowly and amid great peril toward the
                        Station House.......It was a fitting episode of the whole affair. The crowd
                        rushing and eddying to and fro—the night, the yells, the pale
                        faces, many frighten'd people trying in vain to extricate
                        themselves—the attack'd man, not yet freed from the jaws of death,
                        looking like a corpse—the silent resolute half-dozen policemen,
                        with no weapons but their little clubs, yet stern and steady through all
                        those eddying swarms—made indeed a fitting side-scene to the grand
                        tragedy of the murder.......They gain'd the Station House with the protected
                        man, whom they placed in security for the night, and discharged him in the
                        morning.</p>

                    <p>And in the midst of that night-pandemonium of senseless hate, infuriated
                        soldiers, the audience and the crowd—the stage, and all its actors
                        and actresses, its paint-pots, spangles, and gas-lights—the
                        life-blood from those veins, the best and sweetest of the land, drips slowly
                        down, and death's ooze already begins its little bubbles on the
                        lips.......Such, hurriedly sketch'd, were the accompaniments of the death of
                        President Lincoln. So suddenly and in murder and horror unsurpass'd he was
                        taken from us. But his death was painless.</p>

                    <p>[He leaves for America's History and Biography, so far, not only its most
                        dramatic reminiscence—he leaves, in my opinion, the greatest,
                        best, most characteristic, artistic, Personality. Not but that he had
                        faults, and show'd them in the Presidency; but honesty, goodness,
                        shrewdness, conscience, and (a new virtue, unknown to other lands, and
                        hardly yet really known here, but the foundation and tie of all, as the
                        future will grandly develop,) Unionism, in its truest and amplest sense,
                        form'd the hard-pan of his character. These he seal'd with his life. The
                        tragic splendor of his death, purging, illuminating all, throws round his
                        form, his head, an aureole that will remain and will grow brighter through
                        time, while History lives, and love of Country lasts. By many has <hi rend="italic">this Union</hi> been conserv'd and help'd; but if one
                        name, one man, must be pick'd out, he, most of all, is the Conservator of
                        it, to the future. He was assassinated—but the Union is not
                            assassinated—<hi rend="italic">ça ira!</hi> One
                        falls, and another falls. The soldier drops, sinks like a wave—but
                        the ranks of the ocean eternally press on. Death does its work, obliterates
                        a hundred, a thousand—President, general, captain,
                        private—but the Nation is immortal.]</p>

                        have seen a number of them. The sight is worse than any sight of
                        battle-fields or any collections of wounded, even the bloodiest. There was,
                        (as a sample,) one large boat load, of several hundreds, brought about the
                        25th, to Annapolis; and out of the whole number only three individuals were
                        able to walk from the boat. The rest were carried ashore and laid down in
                        one place or another. Can those be <hi rend="italic">men</hi>—those little livid-brown, ash-streak'd, monkey-looking
                        dwarfs?—are they really not mummied, dwindled corpses? They lay
                        there, most of them, quite still, but with a horrible look in their eyes and
                        skinny lips, often with not enough flesh on the lips to cover their teeth.
                        Probably no more appaling sight was ever seen on this earth. (There are
                        deeds, crimes, that may be forgiven; but this is not among them. It steeps
                        its perpetrators in blackest, escapeless, endless damnation. Over 50,000
                        have been compell'd to die the death of starvation—reader, did you
                        ever try to realize what <hi rend="itlaic">starvation</hi> actually
                        is?—in those prisons—and in a land of plenty!)</p>

                    <p>An indescribable meanness, tyranny, aggravating course of insults, almost
                        incredible—was evidently the rule of treatment through all the
                        Southern military prisons. The dead there are not be pitied as much as some
                        of the living that come from there—if they can be call'd
                        living—many them are mentally imbecile, and will never
                        recuperate.</p>

                        heard the sad fact of his death in Hospital here, through his uncle, or the
                        lady from Baltimore, who took his things. (I have not seen them, only heard
                        of them visiting Frank.) I will write you a few lines—as casual
                        friend that sat by his death bed.</p>

                    <p>Your son, Corporal Frank H. Irwin, was wounded near Fort Fisher, Virginia,
                        March 25th, 1865—the wound was in the left knee, pretty bad. He
                        was sent up to Washington, was receiv'd in Ward C, Armory Square Hospital,
                        March 28th—the wound became worse, and on the 4th of April the leg
                        was amputated a little above the knee—the operation was perform'd
                        by Dr. Bliss, one of the best surgeons in the army—he did the
                        whole operation himself—there was a good deal of bad matter
                        gather'd—the bullet was found in the knee. For a couple of weeks
                        afterwards he was doing pretty well. I visited and sat by him frequently, as
                        he was fond of having me. The last ten or twelve days of April I saw that
                        his case was critical. He previously had some fever, with cold spells. The
                        last week in April he was much of the time flighty—but always mild
                        and gentle. He died first</p>

                    <pb facs="ppp.01875.056.jpg" xml:id="leaf028r1" n="51" type="recto"/>

                    <p>of May. The actual cause of death was Pyæmia, (the absorption of the
                        matter in the system instead of its discharge.)</p>

                    <p>Frank, as far as I saw, had everything requisite in surgical treatment,
                        nursing, &amp;c. He had watches much of the time. He was so good and
                        well-behaved, and affectionate, I myself liked him very much. I was in the
                        habit of coming in afternoons and sitting by him, and soothing him, and he
                        liked to have me—liked to put his arm out and lay his hand on my
                        knee—would keep it so a long while. Toward the last he was more
                        restless and flighty at night—often fancied himself with his
                        regiment—by his talk sometimes seem'd as if his feelings were hurt
                        by being blamed by his officers for something he was entirely innocent
                        of—said, "I never in my life was thought capable of such
                        a thing, and never was." At other times he would fancy himself
                        talking as it seem'd to children or such like, his relatives I suppose, and
                        giving them good advice; would talk to them a long while. All the time he
                        was out of his head not one single bad word or thought or idea escaped him.
                        It was remark'd that many a man's conversation in his senses was not half as
                        good as Frank's delirium.</p>

                    <p>He was perfectly willing to die—he had become very weak and had
                        suffer'd a good deal, and was perfectly resign'd, poor boy. I do not know
                        his past life, but I feel as if it must have been good. At any rate what I
                        saw of him here, under the most trying circumstances, with a painful wound,
                        and among strangers, I can say that he behaved so brave, so composed, and so
                        sweet and affectionate, it could not be surpass'd. And now like many other

                        and presently we began talking. He was a middle-aged man, belonged to the 2d
                        Virginia regiment, but lived in Racine, Ohio, and had a family there. He
                        spoke of President Lincoln, and said: "The war is over, and many

                        the soldier. (I found upon further talk he had known Mr. Lincoln personally,

                        As I write this, it is about an hour before sundown. I have walk'd out for a
                        few minutes to the edge of the woods to soothe myself with the hour and
                        scene. It is a glorious, warm, golden-sunny, still afternoon. The only noise
                        here is from a crowd of cawing crows, on some trees three hundred yards
                        distant. Clusters of gnats swimming and dancing in the air in all
                        directions. The oak leaves are thick under the bare trees, and give a strong
                        and delicious perfume.......Inside the Wards every thing is gloomy. Death is
                        there. As I enter'd, I was confronted by it, the first thing. A corpse of a
                        poor soldier, just dead, of typhoid fever. The attendants had just
                        straighten'd the limbs, put coppers on the eyes, and were laying it out.</p>

                        sustainer of spirit and body in some degree, in time of need. These visits
                        varied from an hour or two, to all day or night; for with dear or critical
                        cases I always watch'd all night. Sometimes I took up my quarters in the
                        Hospital, and slept or watch'd there several nights in succession. Those
                        three years I consider the greatest privilege and satisfaction, (with all
                        their feverish excitements and physical deprivations and lamentable sights,)
                        and, of course, the most profound lesson and reminiscence, of my life. I can
                        say that in my ministerings I comprehended all, whoever came in my way,
                        Northern or Southern, and slighted none. It afforded me, too, the perusal of
                        those subtlest, rarest, divinest volumes of Humanity, laid bare in its
                        inmost recesses, and of actual life and death, better than the finest, most
                        labor'd narratives, histories, poems in the libraries. It arous'd and
                        brought out and decided undream'd-of depths of emotion. It has given me my
                        plainest and most fervent views of the true <hi rend="italic">ensemble</hi>
                        and extent of The States. While I was with wounded and sick in thousands of
                        cases from the New England States, and from New York, New Jersey, and
                        Pennsylvania, and from Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and all
                        the Western States, I was with more or less from all the States, North and
                        South, without exception. I was with many from the Border States, especially
                        from Maryland and Virginia; and found, during those lurid years
                        1862–65, far more Union Southerners, especially Tennesseans, than
                        is supposed. I was with many rebel officers and men among our wounded, and
                        gave them always what I had, and tried to cheer them the same as any. I was
                        among the army teamsters considerably, and, indeed, always found myself
                        drawn to them. Among the black soldiers, wounded or sick, and in the
                        contraband camps, I also took my way whenever in their neighborhood, and did
                        what I could for them.</p>

                        forests—from all the noiseless miracles of soil and sun and
                        running streams—how peaceful and how beautiful appear to-day even
                        the Battle-Trenches, and the many hundred thousand Cemetery mounds! Even at
                        Andersonville, to-day, innocence and a smile. (A late account says, 'The
                        stockade has fallen to decay, is grown upon, and a season more will efface
                        it entirely, except from our hearts and memories. The <hi rend="italic">dead

                        there, for most of the old marks the last ten years have obliterated. The
                        thirty-five wells, which the prisoners dug with cups and spoons, remain just
                        as they were left. And the wonderful spring which was discover'd one
                        morning, after a thunder storm, flowing down the hillside, still yields its
                        sweet, pure water as freely now as then. The Cemetery, with its thirteen
                        thousand graves, is on the slope of a beautiful hill. Over the quiet spot
                        already trees give the cool shade which would have been so gratefully sought
                        by the poor fellows whose lives were ended under the scorching sun.')</p>

                    <p>And now, to thought of these—on these graves of the dead of the
                        War, as on an altar—to memory of these, or North or South, I close

                        little tract would prove, at best, but a batch of convulsively written
                        reminiscences. Well, be it so. They are but items, parts of the actual
                        distraction, heat, smoke and excitement of those times—of the
                        qualities that then and there took shape. The War itself with the temper of
                        society preceding it, can indeed be best described by that very word, <hi rend="italic">Convulsiveness.</hi></p>

                        I was personally intimate with, and knew well—it seems to me if I
                        were to make a list of them it would be like a City Directory. Some few only
                        have I mention'd in the foregoing pages—most are dead—a
                        few yet living. There is Reuben Farwell, of Michigan, (little 'Mitch;')
                        Benton H. Wilson, color-bearer, 185th New York; Wm. Stansberry; Manvill
                        Winterstein, Ohio; Bethuel Smith; Capt. Simms, of 51st New York, (kill'd at
                        Petersburg mine explosion,) Capt. Sam. Pooley and Lieut. Fred. McReady, same
                        Reg't. Also, same Reg't., my brother, Geo. W. Whitman—in '61 a
                        young man working in Brooklyn as a carpenter—was not supposed to
                        have any taste for soldiering—but volunteer'd in the ranks at once
                        on the breaking out of the War—continued in active service all
                        through, four years, re-enlisting twice—was promoted, step by
                        step, (several times immediately after battles,) Lieutenant, Captain, Major
                        and Lieut. Colonel—was in the actions at Roanoke, Newbern, 2d Bull
                        Run, Chantilly, South Mountain, Antietam, Fredericksburgh, Vicksburgh,
                        Jackson, the bloody conflicts of the Wilderness, and at Spottsylvania, Cold
                        Harbor, and afterwards around Petersburg. At one of these latter he was
                        taken prisoner, and pass'd four or five months in Secesh military prisons,
                        narrowly escaping with life, from a severe fever, from starvation and
                        half-nakedness in the winter.</p>

                    <p>[What a history that 51st New York had! Went out early—march'd,
                        fought everywhere—was in storms at sea, nearly
                        wreck'd—storm'd forts—tramp'd hither and yon in
                        Virginia, night and day, summer of '62—afterwards Kentucky and
                        Mississippi—re-enlisted—was in all the engagements and
                        campaigns, as above.]</p>

                    <p>I strengthen and comfort myself much with the certainty that the capacity for
                        just such Regiments, (hundreds, thousands of them) is inexhaustible in the
                        United States, and that there isn't a County nor a Township in The
                        Republic—nor a street in any City—but could turn out,
                        and, on occasion, <hi rend="italic">would</hi> turn out, lots of just such
                            <hi rend="italic">Typical Soldiers,</hi> whenever wanted.</p>

                    <p>Before I went down to the Field, and among the Hospitals, I had my hours of
                        doubt about These States; but not since. The bulk of the Army, to me,
                        develop'd, transcended, in personal qualities—and, radically, in
                        moral ones—all that the most enthusiastic Democratic-Republican
                        ever fancied, idealized in loftiest dreams. And curious as it may seem, the
                        War, to me, <hi rend="italic">proved</hi> Humanity, and proved America and
                        the Modern.</p>

                    <p>(I think I am perfectly well aware of the corruption and wickedness of my
                        lands and days—the general political, business and social shams
                        and shysterisms, everywhere. Heaven knows, I see enough of

                        through the Land, as if by electric nerves, and show'd itself in stupendous
                        and practical action, immediately after the firing on <hi rend="italic">the
                            Flag</hi> at Fort Sumter—the Nation ('till then incredulous)
                        flush'd in the face, and all its veins fiercely pulsing and
                        pounding—the arm'd volunteers instantaneously springing up
                        everywhere—the tumultuous processions of the
                        regiments—Was it not grand to have lived in such scenes and days,
                        and be absorb'd by them, and unloosen'd to them?</p>

                    <p>The news of the attack on Sumter was receiv'd in New York city late at night,
                        (13th April, 1861,) and was immediately sent out in extras of the
                        newspapers. I had been to the opera in Fourteenth street that night, and
                        after the performance, was walking down Broadway toward twelve o'clock, on
                        my way to Brooklyn, when I heard in the distance the loud cries of the
                        newsboys, who came presently tearing and yelling up the street, rushing from
                        side to side even more furiously than usual. I bought an extra and cross'd
                        to the Metropolitan Hotel (Niblo's,) where the great lamps were still
                        brightly blazing, and, with a small crowd of others, who gather'd impromptu,
                        read the news, which was evidently authentic. For the benefit of some who
                        had no papers, one of us read the telegram aloud, while all listen'd
                        silently and attentively. No remark was made by any of the crowd, which had
                        increas'd to thirty or forty, but all stood a minute or two, I remember,
                        before they dispers'd. I can almost see them there now, under the lamps at
                        midnight again.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="italic">The ensuing three Months</hi>—<hi rend="italic">The National Uprising and Volunteering.</hi>—I have said in
                        another place that the three Presidentiads preceding 1861 show'd how the
                        weakness and wickedness of rulers are just as eligible here in America under
                        republican, as in Europe under dynastic influences. But what can I say of
                        that prompt and splendid wrestling with Secession-Slavery, the arch enemy
                        personified, the instant he unmistakably show'd his face?......The volcanic
                        upheaval of the Nation, after that firing on the flag at Charleston, proved
                        for certain something which had been previously in great doubt, and at once
                        substantially settled the question of Disunion. In my judgment it will
                        remain as the grandest and most encouraging spectacle yet vouchsafed in any
                        age, old or new, to political progress and Democracy. It was not for what
                        came to the surface merely—though that was important; but what it
                        indicated below, which was of eternal importance.......Down in the abysms of
                        New World humanity there had form'd and harden'd a primal hardpan of
                        National Union Will, determin'd and in the majority, refusing to be tamper'd
                        with or argued against, confronting all emergencies, and capable at any time
                        of bursting all surface-bonds, and breaking out like an earthquake. It is
                        indeed the best lesson of the century, or of America, and it is a mighty
                        privilege to have been part of it.......(Two great spectacles, immortal
                        proofs of Democracy, unequall'd in all the history of the past, are
                        furnish'd by this War—one at the beginning, the other at its
                        close. Those are—the general Voluntary Armed
                        Upheaval—and the peaceful and harmonious Disbanding of the Armies,
                        in the summer of 1865.)</p>

                    <p><hi rend="italic">Contemptuous National feeling.</hi>—Even after
                        the bombardment of Sumter, however, the gravity of the revolt, and the power
                        and will of the Slave States for a strong and continued military resistance
                        to National authority, was not at all realized through the North, except by
                        a few. Nine-tenths of the people of the Free States look'd upon the
                        rebellion, as started in South Carolina, from a feeling one-half of contempt
                        and the other half composed of anger and incredulity. It was not thought it
                        would be join'd in by Virginia, North Carolina or Georgia. A great and
                        cautious National official predicted that it would blow over 'in sixty
                        days,' and folks generally believ'd the prediction. I remember talking about
                        it on a Fulton ferry-boat with the Brooklyn Mayor, who said he only 'hoped
                        the Southern fire-eaters would commit some overt act of resistance, as they
                        would then be at once so effectually squelch'd, we would never hear of
                        Secession again—but he was afraid they never would have the pluck
                        to really do anything.'.......I remember too that a couple of companies of
                        the Thirteenth Brooklyn, who rendezvou'd at the City Armory, and started
                        thence as Thirty Days' Men, were all provided with pieces of rope
                        conspicuously tied to their musket barrels, with which to bring back each
                        man a prisoner from the audacious South, to be led in a noose, on our men's
                        early and triumphal return! [This was indeed the general feeling, and came
                        to the surface. Still, there was a very strong Secession party at the North,
                        as I shall mention in a Note further on.]</p>

                        First Bull Run—certainly, as we now know it, one of the most
                        singular fights on record. (All battles, and their results, are far more
                        matters of accident than is generally thought; but this was throughout a
                        casualty, a chance. Each side supposed it had won, till the last moment. One
                        had in point of fact just the same right to be routed as the other. By a
                        fiction, or series of fictions, the National forces, at the last moment,
                        exploded in a panic, and fled from the field.)</p>

                    <p>The troops commenced pouring into Washington, over the Long Bridge, at
                        day-light on Monday 22d—day drizzling all through with rain.</p>

                    <p>The Saturday and Sunday of the battle, (20th, 21st,) had been parch'd and hot
                        to an extreme—the dust, the grime and smoke, in layers, sweated
                        in, follow'd by other layers, again sweated in, absorb'd by those excited
                        souls—their clothes all saturated with the clay-powder filling the
                        air—stirr'd up everywhere on the dry-roads and trodden fields, by
                        the regiments, swarming wagons, artillery, &amp;c.—all the
                        men, with this coating of murk and sweat and Virginia rain—now
                        recoiling back—pouring over the Long Bridge, a horrible march of
                        twenty miles, returning to Washington baffled, humiliated,
                        panic-struck!......Where are the vaunts, and the proud boasts with which you
                        went forth? Where are your banners, and your bands of music, and your ropes
                        to bring back your prisoners? Well, there isn't a band playing—and
                        there isn't a flag but clings ashamed and lank to its staff.......The sun
                        rises, but shines not. The men appear, at first sparsely and shame-faced
                        enough—then thicker in the streets of Washington—appear
                        in Pennsylvania avenue, and on the steps and basement entrances. They come
                        along in disorderly mobs, some in squads, stragglers, companies.
                        Occasionally, a rare regiment, in perfect order, with its officers (some
                        gaps, dead, the true braves,) marching in silence, with lowering faces,
                        stern, weary to sinking, all black and dirty, but every man with his musket,
                        and stepping alive;—but these are the exceptions.......Sidewalks
                        of Pennsylvania avenue, Fourteenth street, &amp;c., crowded, jamm'd with
                        citizens, darkies, clerks, everybody, lookers-on; women in the windows,
                        curious expressions from faces, as those swarms of dirt-cover'd return'd
                        soldiers there (will they never end?) move by; but nothing said, no
                        comments; (half our lookers-on Secesh of the most venomous
                        kind—they say nothing; but the devil snickers in their faces.)</p>

                    <p>During the forenoon Washington gets motley with the dirt-cover'd
                        soldiers—queer-looking objects, strange eyes and faces, drench'd
                        (the steady rain drizzles on all day) and fearfully worn, hungry, haggard,
                        blister'd in the feet. Good people (but not over-many of them either,) hurry
                        up something for their grub. They put wash-kettles on the fire, for soup,
                        for coffee. They set tables on the side-walks—wagon loads of bread
                        are purchas'd, swiftly cut in stout chunks. Here are two aged ladies,
                        beautiful, the first in the city for culture and charm, they stand with
                        store of eating and drink at an improvised table of rough plank, and give
                        food, and have the store replenish'd from their house every half-hour all
                        that day; and there in the rain they stand, active, silent, white-hair'd,
                        and give food, though the tears stream down their cheeks, almost without
                        intermission, the whole time.</p>

                    <p>Amid the deep excitement, crowds and motion, and desperate eagerness, it
                        seems strange to see many, very many, of the soldiers sleeping—in
                        the midst of all, sleeping sound. They drop down anywhere, on the steps of
                        houses, up close by the basements or fences, on the sidewalk, aside on some
                        vacant lot, and deeply sleep. A poor seventeen or eighteen year old boy lies
                        there, on the stoop of a grand house; he sleeps so calmly, so profoundly!
                        Some clutch their muskets firmly even in sleep. Some in squads; comrades,
                        brothers, close together—and on them, as they lay, sulkily drips
                        the rain.</p>

                    <p>As afternoon pass'd, and evening came, the streets, the bar-rooms, knots
                        everywhere, listeners, questioners, terrible yarns, bugaboo, mask'd
                        batteries, our regiment all cut up, &amp;c.,—stories and
                        story-tellers, windy, bragging, vain centres of street-crowds. Resolution,
                        manliness, seem to have abandon'd Washington. The principal hotel,
                        Willard's, is full of shoulder-straps—thick, crush'd, creeping
                        with shoulder-straps. (I see them, and must have a word with them. There you
                        are, shoulder-straps!—but where are your companies? where are your
                        men? Incompetents! never tell me of chances of battle, of getting stray'd,
                        and the like. I think this is your work, this retreat, after all. Sneak,
                        blow, put on airs there in Willard's sumptuous parlors and bar-rooms, or
                        anywhere—no explanation shall save you. Bull Run is your work; had
                        you been half or one-tenth worthy your men, this would never have
                        happen'd.)</p>

                    <p>Meantime, in Washington, among the great persons and their entourage, a
                        mixture of awful consternation, uncertainty, rage, shame, helplessness, and
                        stupefying disappointment! The worst not only imminent, but already here. In
                        a few hours—perhaps before the next meal—the Secesh
                        generals, with their victorious hordes, will be upon us. The dream of
                        Humanity, the</p>

                    <p>vaunted Union we thought so strong, so impregnable—lo! it is
                        smash'd like a china plate. One bitter, bitter hour—perhaps proud
                        America will never again know such a bitter hour. She must pack and
                        fly—no time to spare. Those white palaces—the
                        dome-crown'd Capitol there on the hill, so stately over the
                        trees—shall they be left—or destroy'd first?.......For
                        it is certain that the talk among the magnates and officers and clerks and
                        officials everywhere, for twenty-four hours in and around Washington, after
                        Bull Run, was loud and undisguised for yielding out and out, and
                        substituting the Southern rule, and Lincoln promptly abdicating and
                        departing. If the Secesh officers and forces had immediately follow'd, and
                        by a bold Napoleonic movement, had enter'd Washington the first day, (or
                        even the second,) they could have had things their own way, and a powerful
                        faction North to back them. One of our returning officers express'd in
                        public that night, amid a swarm of officers and gentlemen in a crowded room,
                        the opinion that it was useless to fight, that the Southerners had made
                        their title clear to their own terms, and that the best course for the
                        National Government to pursue was to desist from any further attempt at
                        stopping them, and admit them again to the lead on the best terms they were
                        willing to grant. Not a voice was rais'd against this judgment amid that
                        large crowd of officers and gentlemen. (The fact is, the hour was one of the
                        three or four of those crises we had during the fluctuations of four years,
                        when human eyes appear'd at least just as likely to see the last breath of
                        the Union as to see it continue.)</p>

                    <p>But the hour, the day, the night pass'd, and whatever returns, an hour, a
                        day, a night like that can never again return. The President, recovering
                        himself, begins that very night—sternly, rapidly sets about the
                        work of reorganizing his forces, and placing himself in positions for future
                        and greater work. If there were nothing else of Abraham Lincoln for history
                        to stamp him with, it is enough to send him with his wreath to the memory of
                        all future time, that he endured that hour, that day, bitterer than
                        gall—indeed a crucifixion day—that it did not conquer
                        him—that he unflinchingly stemm'd it, and resolv'd to lift himself
                        and the Union out of it.</p>

                    <p>Then the great New York papers at once appear'd, (commencing that very
                        evening, and following it up the next morning, and incessantly through many
                        days afterwards,) with leaders that rang out over the land, with the
                        loudest, most reverberating ring of clearest, wildest bugles, full of
                        encouragement, hope, inspiration, unfaltering defiance. Those magnificent
                        editorials! they never flagg'd for a fortnight. The <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> commenced them—I remember the articles well. The
                            <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi> was equally cogent and
                        inspiriting—and the <hi rend="italic">Times, Evening Post,</hi>
                        and other principal papers, were not a whit behind. They came in good time,
                        for they were needed. For in the humiliation of Bull Run, the popular
                        feeling North, from its extreme of superciliousness, recoil'd to the depth
                        of gloom and apprehension.</p>

                    <p>(Of all the days of the War, there are two especially I can never forget.
                        Those were the day following the news, in New York and Brooklyn, of that
                        first Bull Run defeat, and the day of Abraham Lincoln's death. I was home in
                        Brooklyn on both occasions. The day of the murder we heard the news very
                        early in the morning. Mother prepared breakfast—and other meals
                        afterward—as usual; but not a mouthful was eaten all day by either
                        of us. We each drank half a cup of coffee; that was all. Little was said We
                        got every newspaper morning and evening, and the frequent extras of that
                        period, and pass'd them silently to each other.)</p>

                        (long after they left Atlanta,) were marching through South and North
                        Carolina—after leaving Savannah, the news of Lee's capitulation

                        part of the line sending up continued, inspiriting shouts and cries. At
                        intervals every little while, all day long, sounded out the wild music of
                        those peculiar army cries. They would be commenc'd by one regiment or
                        brigade, immediately taken up by others, and at length whole corps and
                        Armies would join in these wild triumphant choruses. It was one of the
                        characteristic expressions of the western troops, and became a habit,
                        serving as relief and outlet the men—a vent for their feelings of
                        victory, returning peace, &amp;c. Morning, noon, and afternoon,
                        spontaneous, for occasion, or without occasion, these huge, strange cries,
                        differing from any other, echoing though the open air for many a mile,
                        expressing youth, joy, wildness, irrepressible strength, and the ideas of
                        advance and conquest, sounded along the swamps and uplands of the South,
                        floating to the skies. ('There never were men that kept in better spirits,
                        in danger or defeat—what then could they do in
                        victory?'—said one of the 15th. Corps to me, afterwards.)</p>

                        for a week. All the marching was comparatively muffled. It was very
                        significant—hardly a loud word or laugh in many of the regiments.
                        A hush and silence pervaded all.</p>

                            War of</hi> 1861-'65.—Looking over my scraps, I find I wrote
                        the following during 1864, or the latter part of '63:</p>

                    <p>The happening to our America, abroad as well as at home, these years, is
                        indeed most strange. The Democratic Republic has paid her to-day the
                        terrible and resplendent compliment of the united wish of all the nations of
                        the world that her Union should be broken, her future out off, and that she
                        should be compell'd to descend to the level of kingdoms and empires
                        ordinarily great! There is certainly not one government in Europe but is now
                        watching the war in this country, with the ardent prayer that the United
                        States may be effectually split, crippled, and dismember'd by it. There is
                        not one but would help toward that dismemberment, if it dared. I say such is
                        the ardent wish to-day of England and of France, as governments, and of all
                        the nations of Europe, as governments. I think indeed it is to-day the real,
                        heartfelt wish of all the nations of the world, with the single exception of
                        Mexico—Mexico, the only one to whom we have ever really done
                        wrong, and now the only one who prays for us and for our triumph, with
                        genuine prayer.</p>

                    <p>Is it not indeed strange? America, made up of all, cheerfully from the
                        beginning opening her arms to all, the result and justifier of all, of
                        Britain, Germany, France and Spain—all here—the
                        accepter, the friend, hope, last resource and general house of
                        all—she who has harm'd none, but been bounteous to so many, to
                        millions, the mother of strangers and exiles, all nations—should
                        now I say be paid this dread compliment of general governmental fear and
                        hatred?.......Are we indignant? alarm'd? Do we feel wrong'd? jeopardized?
                        No; help'd, braced, concentrated, rather. We are all too prone to wander
                        from ourselves, to affect Europe, and watch her frowns and smiles. We need
                        this hot lesson of general hatred, and henceforth must never forget it.
                        Never again will we trust the moral sense nor abstract friendliness of a
                        single <hi rend="italic">government</hi> of the old world.</p>

                        ugliness, held superior points so subtle, yet so palpable, defying the lines
                        of art, making the real life of their faces almost as impossible to depict
                        as a wild perfume or fruit-taste, or a passionate tone of the living

                        singularly ignored. The Northern States were really just as responsible for
                        that War, (in its precedents, foundations, instigations,) as the South. Let
                        me try to give my view.</p>

                    <p>From the age of 21 to 40, (1840-'60,) I was interested in the political
                        movements of the land, not so much as a participant, but as an observer,
                        though a regular voter at the elections. I think I was conversant with the
                        springs of action, and their workings, not only in New York city and
                        Brooklyn, but understood them in the whole country, as I had made leisurely
                        tours through all the Middle States, and partially through the Western and
                        Southern, and down to New Orleans, in which city I resided for some time. (I
                        was there at the conclusion of the Mexican War—saw and talk'd with
                        Gen. Taylor, and the other generals and officers, who were feted and
                        detain'd several days, on their return victorious from that expedition.)</p>

                    <p>Of course many and very contradictory things, specialties, prejudices,
                        Constitutional views, &amp;c., went to make up the origin of the
                        War—but perhaps the most significant general fact can be best
                        indicated and stated as follows: For twenty-five years previous to the
                        outbreak, the controling 'Democratic' nominating
                        conventions—starting from their primaries in wards or districts,
                        and so expanding to counties, powerful cities, States, and to the great
                        President-Naming Conventions—were getting to represent, and to be
                        composed of, more and more putrid and dangerous materials. Let me give a
                        schedule, or</p>

                    <pb facs="ppp.01875.069.jpg" xml:id="leaf034v1" n="64" type="verso"/>

                    <p>list, of one of these representative Conventions for a long time before, and
                        inclusive of, that which nominated Buchanan. (Remember they had come to be
                        the fountains and tissues of the American body politic, forming, as it were,
                        the whole blood, legislation, office-holding, &amp;c.) One of these
                        Conventions from 1840 to '60 exhibited a spectacle such as could never be
                        seen except in our own age and in These States. The members who composed it
                        were, seven-eighths of them, office-holders, office-seekers, pimps,
                        malignants, conspirators, murderers, fancy-men, custom-house clerks,
                        contractors, kept-editors, spaniels well-train'd to carry and fetch,
                        jobbers, infidels, disunionists, terrorists, mail-riflers, slave-catchers,
                        pushers of slavery, creatures of the President, creatures of would-be
                        Presidents, spies, blowers, electioneerers, bawlers, bribers, compromisers,
                        lobbyers, sponges, ruined sports, expell'd gamblers, policy-backers,
                        monte-dealers, duelists, carriers of conceal'd weapons, deaf men, pimpled
                        men, scarr'd inside with vile disease, gaudy outside with gold chains made
                        from the people's money and harlot's money twisted together; crawling,
                        serpentine men, the lousy combings and born freedom-sellers of the earth.
                        And whence came they? From back-yards and bar-rooms; from out of the
                        custom-houses, marshals' offices, post-offices, and gambling hells; from the
                        President's house, the jail, the station-house; from unnamed by-places where
                        devilish disunion was hatched at midnight; from political hearses, and from
                        the coffins inside, and from the shrouds inside of the coffins; from the
                        tumors and abscesses of the land; from the skeletons and skulls in the
                        vaults of the federal almshouses; and from the running sores of the great
                        cities.......Such, I say, form'd the entire personnel, the atmosphere,
                        nutriment and chyle, of our municipal, State and National
                        Politics—substantially permeating, handling, deciding and wielding
                        everything—legislation, nominations, elections, 'public
                        sentiment'. &amp;c.,—while the great masses of the people,
                        farmers, mechanics and traders, were helpless in their gripe. These
                        conditions were mostly prevalent in the North and West, and especially in
                        New York and Philadelphia cities; and the Southern leaders, (bad enough, but
                        of a far higher order,) struck hands and affiliated with, and used
                        them.......Is it strange that a thunder-storm follow'd such morbid and
                        stifling strata?</p>

                    <p>I say then, that what, as just outlined, heralded and made the ground ready
                        for Secession revolt, ought to be held up, through all the future, as the
                        most instructive lesson in American Political History—the most
                        significant warning and beacon-light to coming generations......I say that
                        the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth terms of the American Presidency
                        have shown that the villainy and shallowness of rulers (back'd by the
                        machinery of great parties) are just as eligible to These States as to any
                        foreign despotism, kingdom, or empire—there is not a bit of
                        difference. History is to record those three Presidentiads, and especially
                        the administrations of Fillmore and Buchanan, as so far our topmost warning
                        and shame. Never were publicly display'd more deform'd, mediocre,
                        snivelling, unreliable, false-hearted men! Never were These States so
                        insulted, and attempted to be betray'd! All the main purposes for which the
                        government was establish'd, were openly denied. The perfect equality of
                        slavery with freedom was flauntingly preach'd in the North—nay,
                        the superiority of slavery. The slave trade was proposed to be renew'd.
                        Everywhere frowns and misunderstandings—everywhere exasperations
                        and humiliations.......(The Slavery contest is settled—and the War
                        is over—yet do not those putrid conditions, too many of them,
                        still exist? still result in diseases, fevers, wounds—not of War
                        and Army Hospitals—but the wounds and diseases of Peace?)</p>

                    <p>Out of those generic influences, mainly in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio,
                        &amp;c., arose the attempt at disunion. To philosophical examination,
                        the malignant fever of this war shows its embryonic sources, and the
                        original nourishment of its life and growth, in the North. I say Secession,
                        below the surface, originated and was brought to maturity in the Free
                        States. I allude to the score of years preceding 1860. The events of '61
                        amazed everybody North and South, and burst all prophecies and calculations
                        like bubbles. But even then, and during the whole War, the stern fact
                        remains that (not only did the North put it down, but) <hi rend="italic">the
                            Secession cause had numerically just as many sympathizers in the Free as
                            in the Rebel States.</hi></p>

                    <p>As to slavery, abstractly and practically, (its idea, and the determination
                        to establish and expand it, especially in the new Territories, the future
                        America,) it is too common, I say, to identify it exclusively with the
                        South. In fact down to the opening of the War, the whole country had about
                        an equal hand in it. The North had at least been just as guilty, if not more
                        guilty; and the East and West had. The former Presidents and Congresses had
                        been guilty—the Governors and Legislatures of every Northern State
                        had been guilty, and the Mayors of New York and other northern cities had
                        all been guilty—their hands were all stain'd.</p>

                    <p>So much for that point, and for the North......As to the inception and direct
                        instigation of the War, in the South itself, I shall not attempt interiors
                        or complications. Behind all, the idea that it was from a resolute and
                        arrogant determination on the part of the extreme Slaveholders, the
                        Calhounites, to carry the States Rights' portion of the Constitutional
                        Compact to its farthest verge, and Nationalize Slavery, or else disrupt the
                        Union, and found a new Empire, with Slavery for its corner-stone, was and is
                        undoubtedly the true theory. (If successful, this attempt would of course
                        have destroy'd not only our American Republic, in anything like first-class
                        proportions, in itself and its prestige, but for ages at least, the cause of
                        Liberty and Equality everywhere, and would have been the greatest triumph of
                        reaction, and the severest blow to political and every other freedom,
                        possible to conceive. Its worst results would have inured to the Southern
                        States themselves.)</p>

                    <p>That our National-Democratic experiment, principle, and machinery, could
                        triumphantly sustain such a shock, and that the Constitution could weather
                        it, like a ship a storm, and come out of it as sound and whole as before, is
                        by far the most signal proof yet of the stability of that experiment,
                        Democracy, and of those principles, and that Constitution. But the case is
                        not fully stated at that. It is certain to me that the United States, by
                        virtue of the Secession War and its results, and through that and them only,
                        are now ready to enter, and must certainly enter, upon their genuine career
                        in history, as no more torn and divided in their spinal requisites, but a
                        great Homogeneous Nation,—Free States all—a moral and
                        political unity in variety, such as Nature shows in her grandest physical
                        works, and as much greater than any mere work of Nature, as the moral and
                        political, the work of man, his mind, his soul, are, in their loftiest
                        sense, greater than the merely physical......Out of that War not only has
                        the Nationality of The States escaped from being strangled, but more than
                        any of the rest, and, in my opinion, more than the North itself, the vital
                        heart and breath of the South have escaped as from the pressure of a general
                        nightmare, and are now to enter on a life, development, and active freedom,
                        whose realities are certain in the future, notwithstanding all the Southern
                        vexations and humiliations of the hour—a development which could
                        not possibly have been achiev'd on any less terms, or by any other means
                        than that War, or something equivalent to it. And I predict that the South
                        is yet to outstrip the North.</p>

                    <p>Then another fact, never hitherto broach'd, Nationally—probably
                        several facts, perhaps paradoxical—needing
                        rectification—(for the whole sense and justice of the War must not
                        be supposed to be confined to the Northern point of view.) Is there not some
                        side from which the Secession cause itself has its justification? Was there
                        ever a great popular movement, or revolt, revolution, or attempt at
                        revolution, without some solid basis interwoven with it, and supporting it?
                        at least something that could be said in behalf of it?......We are apt to
                        confine our view to the few more glaring and more atrocious Southern
                        features—the arrogance of most of the leading men and
                        politicians—the fearful crime of Slavery itself—But the
                        time will come—perhaps has come—to begin to take a
                        Philosophical view of the whole affair.</p>

                    <p>Already, as I write this concluding Note to my Memoranda, (Summer, 1875,) a
                        new, maturing generation has swept in, obliterating with oceanic currents
                        the worst reminiscences of the War; and the passage of time has heal'd over
                        at least its deepest scars. Already, the events of 1861–65, and
                        the seasons that immediately preceded, as well as those that closely
                        follow'd them, have lost their direct personal impression, and the living
                        heat and excitement of their own time, and are being marshall'd for casting,
                        or getting ready to be cast, into the cold and bloodless electrotype plates
                        of History. Or, if we admit that the savage temper and wide differences of
                        opinion, and feelings of wrongs, and mutual recriminations, that led to the
                        War, and flamed in its mortal conflagration, may not have yet entirely burnt
                        themselves out, the embers of them are dying embers, and a few more winters
                        and summers, a few more rains and snows, will surely quench their fires, and
                        leave them only as a far off memory. Already the War of Attempted Secession
                        has become a thing of the past.</p>

                    <p>And now I have myself, in my thought, deliberately come to unite the whole
                        conflict, both sides, the South and North, really into One, and to view it
                        as a struggle going on within One Identity. Like any of Nature's great
                        convulsions, wars going on within herself—not from separated sets
                        of laws and influences, but the same—really, efforts, conflicts,
                        most violent ones, for deeper harmony, freer and larger scope, completer
                        homogeneousness and power.</p>

                    <p>What is any Nation, after all—and what is a human
                        being—but a struggle between conflicting, paradoxical, opposing
                        elements—and they themselves and their most violent contests,
                        important parts of that One Identity, and of its development?</p>

                        the greatest coloring feature of their political institutions—a
                        horror and dismay, as of limitless sea and fire, sweeping over them, and
                        substituting the confusion, chaos, and measureless degradation and insult of
                        the present—the black domination, but little above the

                        of course is not to be consider'd for a moment. (Did the vast mass of the
                        blacks, in Slavery in the United States, present a terrible and deeply
                        complicated problem through the just ending century? But how if the mass of
                        the blacks in freedom in the U. S. all through the ensuing century, should
                        present a yet more terrible and more deeply complicated problem?)</p>

                    <p>The conquest of England eight centuries ago, by the
                        Franco-Normans—the obliteration of the old, (in many respects so

                        the land—the old impedimenta removed, even by blood and ruthless
                        violence, and a new, progressive genesis establish'd, new seeds
                        sown—Time has proved plain enough that, bitter as they were, all
                        these were the most salutary series of revolutions that could possibly have
                        happen'd. Out of them, and by them mainly, have come, out of Albic, Roman
                        and Saxon England—and without them could not have
                        come—not only the England of the 500 years down to the present,
                        and of the present—but These States. Nor, except for that terrible
                        dislocation and overturn, would These States, as they are, exist to-day.</p>

                        be anything more certain than the rehabilitated prosperity of the Southern
                        States, all and several, if their growing generations, refusing to be
                        dismay'd by present embarrassments and darkness, accept their position in
                        the Union as an immutable fact, and like the Middle and Western States,
                        "fly the flag of practical industry and business, and adopting the

                        Rather, our preparation, or preface. As the chief and permanent result of
                        those four years, and the signal triumph of Nationalism at the end of them,
                        now commence that History of the United States, which, grandly developing,
                        exfoliating, stretching through the future, is yet to be enacted, and is
                        only to be really written hundreds of years hence.</p>

                    <p>And of the events of that Future—as well as the Present and the
                        Past, or war or peace—have they been, and will they continue to

                        depending on either good luck or bad luck, as may chance to turn out?
                        Rather, is there not, behind all, some vast average, sufficiently definite,
                        uniform and unswervable Purpose, in the development of America, (may I not
                        say divine purpose? only all is divine purpose,) which pursues its own will,
                        maybe unconscious of itself—of which the puerilities often called
                        history, are merely crude and temporary emanations, rather than influences
                        or causes? and of which the justification is only to be look'd for in the
                        formulations of centuries to come? (Let us not be deceiv'd by flatulent

                        defections of the present, and through all the processes of the conscious
                        will, it alone is the permanent and sovereign force, destined to carry on
                        the New World to fulfil its destinies in the future—to resolutely

                        past vision, present thought—to form and fashion, and for the
                        general type, Men and Women more noble, more athletic than the world has yet
                        seen—to gradually, firmly blend, from all The States, with all
                        varieties, a friendly, happy, free, religious Nationality—a
                        Nationality not only the richest, most inventive, most productive and
                        materialistic the world has yet known—but compacted indissolubly,
                        and out of whose ample and solid bulk, and giving purpose and finish to it,
                        Conscience, Morals, and all the Spiritual attributes, shall surely rise,
                        like spires above some group of edifices, firm-footed on the earth, yet
                        scaling space and heaven.</p>

                    <p>No more considering the United States as an incident, or series of incidents,

                        improvements, vulgar and lucky, ahead of other nations and times, I would
                        finally plant, as seeds, these thoughts or speculations in the growth of our
                        Republic—that it is the deliberate culmination and result of all
                        the Past—that here too, as in all departments of the Universe,
                        regular laws, (slow and sure in acting, slow and sure in ripening,) have
                        controll'd and govern'd, and will yet control and govern—and that
                        those laws can no more be baffled or steer'd clear of, or vitiated, by
                        chance, or any fortune or opposition, than the laws of winter and summer, or
                        darkness and light.</p>

                    <p>The old theory of a given country or age, or people, as something isolated
                        and standing by itself—something which only fulfils its luck,
                        eventful or uneventful—or perhaps some meteor, brilliantly
                        flashing on the background or foreground of Time—is indeed no
                        longer advanced among competent minds, as a theory for History—has
                        been supplanted by theories far wider and higher.........The development of
                        a Nation—of the American Republic, for instance, with all its
                        episodes of peace and war—the events of the past, and the facts of
                        the present—aye, the entire political and intellectual processes
                        of our common race—if beheld from a point of view sufficiently
                        comprehensive, would doubtless exhibit the same regularity of order and
                        exactness, and the same plan of cause and effect, as the crops in the
                        ground, or the rising and setting of the stars.</p>

                    <p>Great as they are, therefore, and greater far to be, the United States too
                        are but a series of steps in the eternal process of creative thought. And
                        here is to my mind their final justification, and certain perpetuity. There
                        is in that sublime process, in the laws of the Universe—and, above
                        all, in the moral law—something that would make unsatisfactory,
                        and even vain and contemptible, all the triumphs of war, the gains of peace,
                        and the proudest worldly grandeur of all the Nations that have ever existed,
                        or that, (ours included,) now exist, except that we constantly see, through
                        all their worldly career, however struggling and blind and lame, attempts,
                        by all ages, all peoples, according to their development, to reach, to
                        press, to progress on, and farther on, to more and more advanced ideals.</p>

                    <p>The glory of the Republic of The United States, in my opinion, is to be,
                        that, emerging in the light of the Modern and the splendor of Science, and
                        solidly based on the past, it is to cheerfully range itself, and its
                        politics are henceforth to come, under those universal laws, and embody
                        them, and carry them out to serve them......And as only that individual
                        becomes truly great who understands well that, (while complete in himself in
                        a certain sense,) he is but a part of the divine, eternal scheme, and whose
                        special life and laws are adjusted to move in harmonious relations with the
                        general laws of Nature, and especially with the moral law, the deepest and
                        highest of all, and the last vitality of Man or State—so those
                        Nations, and so the United States, may only become the greatest and the most
                        continuous, by understanding well their harmonious relations with entire
                        Humanity and History, and all their laws and progress, and sublimed with the
                        creative thought of Deity, through all time, past, present and future. Thus
                        will they expand to the amplitude of their destiny, and become splendid
                        illustrations and culminating parts of the Kosmos, and of Civilization.</p>

                    <p>Are not these—or something like these—the simple,
                        perennial Truths now presented to the Future of the United States, out of
                        all its Past, of war and</p>

                    <pb facs="ppp.01875.073.jpg" xml:id="leaf036v1" n="68" type="verso"/>

                    <p>peace? Has not the time come for working them in the tissue of the coming
                        History and Politics of The States? And, (as gold and silver are cast into
                        small coin,) are not, for their elucidation, entirely new classes of men,
                        uncommitted to the past, fusing The Whole Country, adjusted to its
                        conditions, present and to come, imperatively required, Seaboard and
                        Interior, North and South? and must not such classes begin to arise, and be
                        emblematic of our New Politics and our real Nationality?</p>

                    <p>Now, and henceforth, and out of the conditions, the results of the War, of
                        all the experiences of the past—demanding to be rigidly construed
                        with reference to the whole Union, not for a week or year, but immense
                        cycles of time, come crowding and gathering in presence of America, like
                        veil'd giants, original, native, larger questions, possibilities, problems,
                        than ever before. To-day, I say, the evolution of The United States, (South,
                        and Atlantic Seaboard, and especially of the Mississippi Valley, and the
                        Pacific slope,) coincident with these thoughts and problems, and their own
                        vitality and amplitude, and winding steadily along through the unseen vistas
                        of the future, affords the greatest moral and political work in all the
                        so-far progress of Humanity. And fortunately, to-day, after the experiments
                        and warnings of a hundred years, we can pause and consider and provide for
                        these problems, under more propitious circumstances, and new and native
                        lights, and precious even if costly experiences—with more
                        political and material advantages to illumine and solve them—than
                        were ever hitherto possess'd by a Nation.</p>

                    <p>Yes: The summing-up of the tremendous moral and military perturbations of
                        1861-'65, and their results—and indeed of the entire hundred years
                        of the past of our National experiment, from its inchoate movement down to
                        the present day, (1775–1876)—is, that they all now
                        launch The United States fairly forth, consistently with the entirety of
                        Civilization and Humanity, and in main sort the representative of them,
                        leading the van, leading the fleet of the Modern and Democratic, on the seas
                        and voyages of the Future.</p>

                    <p>And the real History of the United States—starting from that great
                        convulsive struggle for Unity, triumphantly concluded, and <hi rend="italic">the South</hi> victorious, after all—is only to be written at
                        the remove of hundreds, perhaps a thousand, years hence.</p>
