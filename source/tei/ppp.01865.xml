                  <l>—O banner! not money so precious are you, nor farm <lb/>produce you, nor

                  <l>Nor excellent stores, nor landed on wharves from the <lb/>ships;</l>

                  <l>Divider of day-break you, cutting the air, touch'd by <lb/>the sun, measuring

                  <l>O you up there! O pennant! where you undulate like <lb/>a snake, hissing so

                  <l>So loved! O you banner leading the day, with stars <lb/>brought from the

                <l><hi rend="small caps">VIGIL</hi> strange I kept on the field one night,</l>
                <l>When you, my son and my comrade, dropt at my side <lb/>that day,</l>
                <l>One look I but gave, which your dear eyes return'd,<lb/>with a look I shall never
                  forget;</l>
                <l>One touch of your hand to mine, O boy, reach'd up as <lb/>you lay on the
                  ground;</l>
                <l>Then onward I sped in the battle, the even-contested <lb/>battle;</l>
                <l>Till late in the night reliev'd, to the place at last again I <lb/>made my
                  way;</l>
                <l>Found you in death so cold, dear comrade—found your <lb/>body, son of
                  responding kisses, (never again on <lb/>earth responding;)</l>
                <l>Bared your face in the starlight—curious the scene— <lb/>cool blew
                  the moderate night-wind;</l>
                <l>Long there and then in vigil I stood, dimly around me <lb/>the battle-field
                  spreading;</l>
                <l>Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet, there in the fragrant <lb/>silent night;</l>
                <l>But not a tear fell, not even a long-drawn sigh—Long,<lb/>long I gazed;</l>
                <l>Then on the earth partially reclining, sat by your side,<lb/>leaning my chin in
                  my hands;</l>
                <l>Passing sweet hours, immortal and mystic hours with <lb/>you, dearest
                  comrade—Not a tear, not a word;</l>
                <l>Vigil of silence, love and death—vigil for you, my son <lb/>and my
                  soldier,</l>
                <l>As onward silently stars aloft, eastward new ones <choice><orig>up-<lb/>ward</orig><reg>upward</reg>
                  </choice> stole;</l>
                <l>Vigil final for you, brave boy, (I could not save you,<lb/>swift was your

                <pb facs="ppp.01865.049.jpg" xml:id="leaf025r1" n="43" type="recto"/>

                <l>I faithfully loved you and cared for you living—I think <lb/>we shall
                  surely meet again;)</l>
                <l>Till at latest lingering of the night, indeed just as the <lb/>dawn appear'd,</l>
                <l>My comrade I wrapt in his blanket, envelop'd well his <lb/>form,</l>
                <l>Folded the blanket well, tucking it carefully over head,<lb/>and carefully under
                  feet;</l>
                <l>And there and then, and bathed by the rising sun, my<lb/>son in his grave, in his
                  rude-dug grave I <choice><orig>de-<lb/>posited</orig><reg>deposited</reg></choice>;</l>
                <l>Ending my vigil strange with that—vigil of night and <lb/>battle-field
                  dim;</l>
                <l>Vigil for boy of responding kisses, (never again on earth <lb/>responding;)</l>
                <l>Vigil for comrade swiftly slain—vigil I never forget,<lb/>how as day
                  brighten'd,</l>
                <l>I rose from the chill ground, and folded my soldier well <lb/>in his blanket,</l>
                <l>And buried him where he fell.</l>

                <l><hi rend="small caps">A MARCH</hi> in the ranks hard-prest, and the road
                  unknown;</l>
                <l>A route through a heavy wood, with muffled steps in the <lb/>darkness;</l>
                <l>Our army foil'd with loss severe, and the sullen remnant <lb/>retreating;</l>
                <l>Till after midnight glimmer upon us, the lights of a <lb/>dim-lighted
                  building;</l>
                <l>We come to an open space in the woods, and halt by the <lb/>dim-lighted
                  building;</l>
                <l>'Tis a large old church, at the crossing roads—'tis now <lb/>an impromptu
                  hospital;</l>
                <l>—Entering but for a minute, I see a sight beyond all <lb/>the pictures and
                  poems ever made:</l>
                <l>Shadows of deepest, deepest black, just lit by moving <lb/>candles and lamps,</l>
                <l>And by one great pitchy torch, stationary, with wild red <lb/>flame, and clouds
                  of smoke;</l>
                <l>By these, crowds, groups of forms, vaguely I see, on the <lb/>floor, some in the
                  pews laid down;</l>
                <l>At my feet more distinctly, a soldier, a mere lad, in<lb/>danger of bleeding to
                  death, (he is shot in the <choice><orig>ab-<lb/>domen</orig><reg>abdomen</reg></choice>;)</l>
                <l>I staunch the blood temporarily, (the youngster's face is <lb/>white as a
                  lily;)</l>
                <l>Then before I depart I sweep my eyes o'er the scene,<lb/>fain to absorb it
                  all;</l>
                <l>Faces, varieties, postures beyond description, most in <lb/>obscurity, some of
                  them dead;</l>
                <l>Surgeons operating, attendants holding lights, the smell <lb/>of ether, the odor
                  of blood;</l>

                <pb facs="ppp.01865.051.jpg" xml:id="leaf026r1" n="45" type="recto"/>

                <l>The crowd, O the crowd of the bloody forms of soldiers <lb/>—the yard
                  outside also fill'd;</l>
                <l>Some on the bare ground, some on planks or stretchers,<lb/>some in the
                  death-spasm sweating;</l>
                <l>An occasional scream or cry, the doctor's shouted orders <lb/>or calls;</l>
                <l>The glisten of the little steel instruments catching the <lb/>glint of the
                  torches;</l>
                <l>These I resume as I chant—I see again the forms, I <lb/>smell the odor;</l>
                <l>Then hear outside the orders given, <hi rend="italic">Fall in, my men,</hi>
                  <lb/><hi rend="italic">Fall in;</hi>
                </l>
                <l>But first I bend to the dying lad—his eyes open—a <lb/>half-smile
                  gives he me;</l>
                <l>Then the eyes close, calmly close, and I speed forth to <lb/>the darkness,</l>
                <l>Resuming, marching, as ever in darkness marching, on <lb/>in the ranks,</l>
                <l>The unknown road still marching.</l>
