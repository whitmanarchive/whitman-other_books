      <font size="-1">That angels are human forms, or men, I have seen a
       thousand<br/> times. I have also frequently told them that men in the
       Christian<br/> world are in such gross ignorance respecting Angels and
       Spirits as to<br/> suppose them to be minds without a form, or mere
       thoughts, of which<br/> they have no other idea than as something
       ethereal possessing a vital<br/> principle. To the first or ultimate
       heaven also correspond the forms<br/> of man&rsquo;s body, called its
       members, organs, and viscera. Thus the<br/> corporeal part of man is that
       in which heaven ultimately closes, and<br/> upon which, as on its base,
       it rests.<br/>

      daguerreotype,<br/> given in the original "L<font size="-2">EAVES

      aware that any other engraved likeness of Whitman is extant; and<br/> have
      considered it on the whole more safe and satisfactory to take this<br/>
      fine record of the poet in his earlier prime than to risk the chances
      of<br/> engraving at first hand from a photograph of his present more
      matured<br/> aspect.</font>

      >COTT</font>;&#8212;Among various gifts which I have<br/> received from
      you, tangible and intangible, was a copy of<br/> the original quarto
      edition of Whitman&rsquo;s <i>Leaves of Grass</i>,<br/> which you
      presented to me soon after its first appearance<br/> in 1855. At a time
      when few people on this side of the<br/> Atlantic had looked into the
      book, and still fewer had<br/> found in it anything save matter for
      ridicule, you had<br/> appraised it, and seen that its value was real and
      great.<br/> A true poet and a strong thinker like yourself was indeed<br/>
      likely to see that. I read the book eagerly, and perceived<br/> that its
      substantiality and power were still ahead of any<br/> eulogium with which
      it might have been commended to<br/> me&#8212;and, in fact, ahead of
      most attempts that could be<br/> made at verbal definition of them.<br/>
      <div class="INDENTED">Some years afterwards, getting to know our
       friend<br/> Swinburne, I found with much satisfaction that he also<br/>
       was an ardent (not of course a <i>blind</i>) admirer of Whitman.<br/>
       Satisfaction, and a degree almost of surprise; for his<br/> intense sense
       of poetic refinement of form in his own<br/>

       <br/> works, and his exacting acuteness as a critic, might have<br/>
       seemed likely to carry him away from Whitman in sym-<br/> pathy at least,
       if not in actual latitude of perception.<br/> Those who find the American
       poet "utterly formless,"<br/> "intolerably rough and floundering,"
       "destitute of the<br/> A B C of art," and the like, might not
       unprofitably ponder<br/> this very different estimate of him by the
       author of<br/>
       <i>Atalanta in Calydon</i>.<br/>
       <div class="INDENTED">May we hope that now, twelve years after the
        first<br/> appearance of <i>Leaves of Grass</i>, the English reading
        public<br/> may be prepared for a selection of Whitman&rsquo;s
        poems, and<br/> soon hereafter for a complete edition of them? I
        trust<br/> this may prove to be the case. At any rate, it has been<br/>
        a great gratification to me to be concerned in the experi-<br/> ment;
        and this is enhanced by my being enabled to as-<br/> sociate with it
        your name, as that of an early and well-<br/> qualified appreciator of
        Whitman, and no less as that<br/> of a dear friend.<br/>

       <br/>
       <br/> DURING the summer of 1867 I had the opportunity<br/> (which I had
       often wished for) of expressing in<br/> print my estimate and admiration
       of the works of the<br/> American poet Walt Whitman.* Like a stone
       dropped<br/> into a pond, an article of that sort may spread out its<br/>
       concentric circles of consequences. One of these is the<br/> invitation
       which I have received to edit a selection from<br/> Whitman&rsquo;s
       writings: virtually the first sample of his<br/> work ever published in
       England, and offering the first<br/> tolerably fair chance he has had of
       making his way with<br/> English readers on his own showing. Hitherto,
       such<br/> reader&#8212;except the small percentage of them to whom
       it<br/> has happened to come across the poems in some one of<br/> their
       American editions&#8212;have picked acquaintance with<br/> them only
       through the medium of newspaper extracts<br/> and criticisms, mostly
       short-sighted, sneering, and depre-<br/> ciatory, and rather intercepting
       than forwarding the candid<br/>

       <br/> construction which people mich be willing to put upon<br/> the
       poems, alike in their beauties and their aberrations.<br/> Some English
       critics, no doubt, have been more discern-<br/> ing&#8212;as W. J.
       Fox, of old, in the <i>Dispatch</i>, the writer of<br/> the notice in the
        <i>Leader</i>, and of late two on the <i>Pall Mall<br/> Gazette</i> and
       the <i>London Review;</i>* but these have been the<br/> exceptions among
       us, the great majority of the reviewers<br/> presenting that happy and
       familiar critical combination&#8212;<br/> scurrility and superciliousness.<br/>
       <div class="INDENTED">As it was my lot to set down so recently several of
        the<br/> considerations which seem to me most essential and most<br/>
        obvious in regard to Whitman&rsquo;s writings, I can scarcely<br/>
        now recur to the subject without either repeating some-<br/> thing of
        what I then said, or else leaving unstated some<br/> points of principal
        importance. I shall therefore adopt<br/> the simplest
        course&#8212;that of summarizing the critical re-<br/> marks in my
        former article; after which, I shall leave<br/> without further
        development (ample as is the amount of<br/> development most of them
        would claim) the particular<br/> topics there glanced at, and shall
        proceed to some other<br/> phases of the subject.<br/>
        <div class="INDENTED">Whitman republished in 1867 his complete
         poetical<br/> works in one moderate-sized volume, consisting of

         Taps</i>,<br/> with its <i>Sequel</i>. It has been intimated that he
         does not exe<br/> pect to write any more poems, unless it might be in
         expres-<br/> sion of the religious side of man&rsquo;s nature.
         However, one<br/> poem on the last American harvest, sown and reaped
         by<br/> those who had been soldiers in the great war, has already<br/>
         appeared since the volume in question, and has been re-<br/> published
         in England.<br/>
         <div class="INDENTED">Whitman&rsquo;s poems present no trace of
          rhyme, save in a<br/> couple or so of chance instances. Parts of them,
          indeed,<br/> may be regarded as a warp of prose amid the weft of<br/>
          poetry, such as Shakespeare furnishes the precedent for in<br/> drama.
          Still there is a very powerful and majestic<br/> rhythmical sense throughout.<br/>
          <div class="INDENTED">Lavish and persistent has been the abuse poured
           forth<br/> upon Whitman by his own countrymen; the tricklings of<br/>
           the British press give but a moderate idea of it. The<br/> poet is
           known to repay scorn with scorn. Emerson can,<br/> however, from the
           first be claimed as on Whitman&rsquo;s side;<br/> nor, it is
           understood after some enquiry, has the great<br/> thinker since then
           retreated from this position in funda-<br/> mentals, although his
           admiration may have entailed some<br/> worry upon him, and reports of
           his recantation had been<br/> rife. Of other writers on
           Whitman&rsquo;s side, expressing<br/> themselves with no measured
           enthusiasm, one may cite<br/>

           <br/> Mr. M. D. Conway; Mr. W. D. O&rsquo;Connor, who wrote
           a<br/> pamphlet named <i>The Good Gret Poet;</i> and Mr. John<br/>
           Burroughs, author of <i>Walt Whitman as Poet and<br/> Person</i>,
           published quite recently in New York. His<br/> thorough-paced
           admirers declare Whitman to be beyond<br/> rivalry <i>the</i> poet of
           the epoch; an estimate which, startling<br/> as it will sound at the
           first, may nevertheless be upheld,<br/> on the grounds that Whitman
           is beyond all his com-<br/> petitors a man of the period, one of
           audacious personal<br/> ascendant, incapable of all compromise, and
           an initiator in<br/> the scheme and form of his works.<br/>
           <div class="INDENTED">Certain faults are charged against him, and, as
            far as<br/> they are true, shall frankly stand
            confessed&#8212;some of them<br/> as very serious faults.
            Firstly, he speaks on occasion of<br/> gross things in gross, crude,
            or plain terms. Secondly,<br/> he uses some words absurd or
            ill-constructed, others which<br/> produce a jarring effect in
            poetry, or indeed in any lofty<br/> literature. Thirdly, he sins
            from time to time by being<br/> obscure, fragmentary, and
            agglomerative&#8212;giving long<br/> strings of successive and
            detached items, not, however,<br/> devoid of a certain primitive
            effectiveness. Fourthly, his<br/> self-assertion is boundless; yet
            not always to be under-<br/> stood as strictly or merely personal to
            himself, but some-<br/> times as vicarious, the poet speaking on
            behalf of all men,<br/> and every man and woman. These and any other
            faults<br/> appear most harshly on a cursory reading; Whitman is
            a<br/> poet who bears and needs to be read as a whole, and then<br/>

             <br/> turesqueness it has, but mostly of a somewhat
             patriarchal<br/> kind, not deriving from the "word-painting" of the<br/>
             <i>litt&eacute;rateur;</i> a certain echo of the old Hebrew
             poetry may<br/> even be caught in it, extra-modern though it is.
             Another<br/> most prominent and pervading quality of the book is
             the<br/> exuberant physique of the author. The conceptions are<br/>
             throughout those of a man in robust health, and might alter<br/>
             much under different conditions.<br/>
             <div class="INDENTED">Further, there is a strong tone of paradox in
              Whitman&rsquo;s<br/> writing. He is both a realist and an
              optimist in extreme<br/> measure: he contemplates evil as in some
              sense not<br/> existing, or, if existing, then as being of as much
              im-<br/> portance as anything else. Not that he is a
              materialist;<br/> on the contrary, he is a most strenuous assertor
              of the<br/> soul, and, with the soul, of the body as its
              infallible asso-<br/> ciate and vehicle in the present frame of
              things. Neither<br/> does he drift into fatalism or
              indifferentism; the energy of<br/> his temperament, and ever-fresh
              sympathy with national<br/> and other developments, being an
              effectual bar to this.<br/> The paradoxical element of the poems
              is such that one<br/> may sometimes find them in conflict with
              what has pre-<br/> ceded, and would not be much surprised if they
              said at<br/> any moment the reverse of whatever they do say. This
              is<br/> mainly due to the multiplicity of the aspects of things,
              and<br/> to the immense width of relation in which Whitman
              stands<br/> to all sorts and all aspects of them.<br/>

             <br/> and entire originality. He may be termed formless by<br/>
             those who, not without much reason to show for them-<br/> selves,
             are wedded to the established forms and ratified<br/> refinements
             of poetic art; but it seems reasonable to<br/> enlarge the canon
             till it includes so great and startling a<br/> genius, rather than
             to draw it close and exclude him.<br/> His work is practically
             certain to stand as archetypal for<br/> many future poetic
             efforts&#8212;so great is his power as an<br/> originator, so
             fervid his initiative. It forms incomparably<br/> the
             <i>largest</i> performance of our period in poetry. Victor<br/>
             Hugo&rsquo;s <i>L&eacute;gende des Si&egrave;cles</i>
             alone might be named with<br/> it for largeness, and even that with
             much less of a new<br/> starting-point in conception and treatment.
             Whitman<br/> breaks with all precedent. To what he himself
             perceives<br/> and knows he has a personal relation of the
             intensest kind;<br/> to anything in the way of prescription, no
             relation at all.<br/> But he is saved from isolation by the depth
             of his Ameri-<br/> canism; with the movement of his predominant
             nation he<br/> is moved. His comprehension, energy, and tenderness,
             are<br/> all extreme, and all inspired by actualities. And, as
             for<br/> poetic genius, those who, without being ready to
             concede<br/> that faculty to Whitman, confess his iconoclastic
             boldness<br/> and his Titanic power of temperament, working in
             the<br/> sphere of poetry, do in effect confess his genius as<br/> well.<br/>

             <br/> remains to say something a little more precise of the<br/>
             particular qualities of his works. And first, not to slur<br/> over
             defects, I shall extract some sentences from a letter<br/> which a
             friend, most highly entitled to form and express an<br/> opinion on
             any poetic question&#8212;one, too, who abundantly<br/> upholds
             the greatness of Whitman as a poet&#8212;has addres-<br/> sed to
             me with regard to the criticism above condensed.<br/> His
             observations, though severe on this individual point,<br/> appear
             to me not other than correct. "I don&rsquo;t think<br/> that
             you quite put strength enough into your blame on<br/> one side,
             while you make at least enough of minor faults<br/> or
             eccentricities. To me it seems always that Whitman&rsquo;s<br/>
             great flaw is a fault of debility, not an excess of strength<br/>
             &#8212;I mean his bluster. His own personal and national
             self-<br/> reliance and arrogance, I need not tell you, I
             applaud,<br/> and sympathize and rejoice in; but the blatant
             ebullience<br/> of feeling and speech, at times, is feeble for so
             great a<br/> poet of so great a people. He is in part certainly the
             poet<br/> of democracy; but not wholly, <i>because</i> he tries so
             openly to<br/> be, and asserts so violently that he
             is&#8212;always as if he was<br/> fighting the cause out on a
             platform. This is the only thing<br/> I really or greatly dislike
             or revolt from. On the whole"<br/> (adds my correspondent) "my
             admiration and enjoyment<br/> of his greatness grow keener and
             warmer every time I<br/> think of him"&#8212;a feeling, I may be
             permitted to ob-<br/> serve, which is fully shared by myself, and,

              expresses. He scans and presents and enormous panorama,<br/>
              unrolled before him as from a mountain-top; and yet<br/> whatever
              most large or most minute or casual thing his<br/> eye glances
              upon, that he enters into with a depth of<br/> affection which
              identifies him with it for the time, be the<br/> object what it
              may. There is a singular interchange<br/> also of actuality and of
              ideal substratum and suggestion.<br/> While he sees men, with even
              abnormal exactness and<br/> sympathy, as men, he sees them also
              "as trees walking,"<br/> and admits us to perceive that the whole
              show is in a<br/> measure spectral and unsubstantial, and the mask
              of a<br/> larger and profounder reality beneath it, of which it
              is<br/> giving perpetual intimations and auguries. He is the
              poet<br/> indeed of literality, but of passionate and
              significant<br/> literality, full of indirections as well as
              directness, and of<br/> readings between the lines. If he is the
              &rsquo;cutest of Yankees,<br/> he is also as truly an
              enthusiast as any the most typical poet.<br/> All his faculties
              and performance glow into a white<br/> heat of brotherliness; and

             <br/> discriminates them quite as much as their modernness,<br/>
             audacity, or any other exceptional point. If the reader<br/> wishes
             to see the great and more intimate powers of<br/> Whitman in their
             fullest expression, he may consult the<br/>
             <i>Nocturn for the Death of Lincoln;</i> than which it would<br/>
             be difficult to find anywhere a purer, more elevated,<br/> more
             poetic, more ideally abstract, or at the same time<br/> more
             pathetically personal, threnody&#8212;uniting the thrilling<br/>
             chords of grief, of beauty, of triumph, and of final un-<br/>
             fathomed satisfaction. With all his singularities, Whitman<br/> is
             a master of words and of sounds: he has them at his<br/>
             command&#8212;made for, and instinct with, his
             purpose&#8212;<br/> messengers of unsurpassable sympathy and
             intelligence<br/> between himself and his readers. The entire book
             may<br/> be called the p&aelig;an of the natural
             man&#8212;not of the merely<br/> physical, still less of the
             disjunctively intellectual or<br/> spiritual man, but of him who,
             being a man first and fore-<br/> most, is therein also a spirit and

             <div class="INDENTED">Walt Whitman (we infer that he was in fact
              baptized<br/> Walter, like his father, but he always uses the name
              Walt)<br/> was born at the farm-village of West Hills, Long
              Island,<br/> in the State of New York, and about thirty miles
              distant<br/> from the capital, on the 31st of May 1819. His
              father&rsquo;s<br/> family, English by origin, had already
              been settled in this<br/> locality for five generations. His
              mother, named Louisa<br/> van Velsor, was of Dutch extraction, and
              came from Cold<br/> Spring, Queen&rsquo;s Country, about three
              miles from West<br/> Hills. "A fine-looking old lady" she has been
              termed in<br/> her advanced age. A large family ensued from the
              mar-<br/> riage. The father was a farmer, and afterwards a
              car-<br/> penter and builder: both parents adhered in religion
              to<br/> "the great Quaker iconoclast, Elias Hicks." Walt was<br/>
              schooled at Brooklyn, a suburb of New York, and began<br/> life at
              the age of thirteen, working as a printer, later on as a<br/>

             <br/> New York. From 1837 to 1848 he had, as Mr. Burroughs<br/> too
             promiscuously expresses it, "sounded all experiences of<br/> life,
             with all their passions, pleasures, and abandonments."<br/> In 1849
             he began travelling; and became at New Orleans a<br/> newspaper
             editor, and at Brooklyn, two years afterwards,<br/> a printer. He
             next followed his father&rsquo;s business of car-<br/> penter
             and builder. In 1862, after the breaking-out of<br/> the great
             Civil War, in which his enthusiastic unionism<br/> and also his
             anti-slavery feelings attached him inseparably<br/> though not
             rancorously to the good cause of the North,<br/> he undertook the
             nursing of the sick and wounded in the<br/> field, writing also a
             correspondence in the <i>New York<br/> Times</i>. I am informed
             that it was through Emerson&rsquo;s<br/> intervention that he
             obtained the sanction of President<br/> Lincoln for this purpose of
             charity, with authority to<br/> draw the ordinary army rations;
             Whitman stipulating at<br/> the same time that he would not receive
             any remunera-<br/> tion for his services. The first immediate
             occasion of his<br/> going down to cam was on behalf of his
             brother, Lieu-<br/> tenant-Colonel George W. Whitman, of the 51st
             New<br/> York Veterans, who had been struck in the face by a<br/>
             piece of shell at Fredericksburg. From the spring of<br/> 1863,
             this nursing, both in the field and more especially<br/> in
             hospital at Washington, became his "one daily and<br/> nightly
             occupation;" and the strongest testimony is borne<br/> to his
             measureless self-devotion and kindliness in the<br/> work, and to
             the unbounded fascination, a kind of magnetic<br/>

             <br/> attraction and ascendency, which he exercised over the<br/>
             patients, often with the happiest sanitary results. North-<br/>
             erner or Southerner, the belligerents received the same<br/>
             tending from him. It is said that by the end of the war<br/> he had
             personally ministered to upwards of 100,000 sick<br/> and wounded.
             In a Washington hospital he caught, in<br/> the summer of 1864, the
             first illness he had ever known,<br/> caused by poison absorbed
             into the system in attending<br/> some of the worst causes of
             gangrene. It disabled him for<br/> six months. He returned to the
             hospitals towards the<br/> beginning of 1865, and obtained also a
             clerkship in the<br/> Department of the Interior. It should be
             added that,<br/> though he never actually joined the army as a
             combatant,<br/> he made a point of putting down his name on the
             enrol-<br/> ment-lists for the draft, to take his chance as it
             might<br/> happen for serving the country in arms. The reward
             of<br/> his devotedness came at the end of June 1856, in the<br/>
             form of dismissal from his clerkship by the minister, Mr.<br/>
             Harlan, who learned that Whitman was the author of the<br/>
             <i>Leaves of Grass:</i> a book whose outspokenness, or (as<br/> the
             official chief considered it) immorality, raised a holy<br/> horror
             in the ministerial breast. The poet, however,<br/> soon obtained
             another modest but creditable post in the<br/> office of the
             Attorney-General. He still visits the<br/> hospitals on Sundays,
             and often on other days as<br/> well.<br/>

             <br/> volume is taken from an engraving after a daguerreotype<br/>
             given in the original <i>Leaves of Grass</i>. He is much above<br/>
             the average size, and noticeably well-proportioned&#8212;a<br/>
             model of physique and health, and, by natural con-<br/> sequence,
             as fully and finely related to all physical facts<br/> by his
             bodily constitution as to all mental and spiritual<br/> facts by
             his mind and his consciousness. He is now, how-<br/> ever,
             old-looking for his years, and might even (according<br/> to the
             statement of one of his enthusiasts, Mr. O&rsquo;Connor)<br/>
             have passed for being beyond the age for the draft when<br/> the
             war was going on. The same gentleman, in confuta-<br/> tion of any
             inferences which might be drawn from the<br/>
             <i>Leaves of Grass</i> by a Harlan or other Holy Willie,
             affirms<br/> that "one more irreproachable in his relations to the
             other<br/> sex lives not upon this earth"&#8212;an assertion
             which one<br/> must take as one finds it, having neither
             confirmatory nor<br/> traversing evidence at hand. Whitman has
             light blue<br/> eyes, a florid complexion, a fleecy beard now grey,
             and a<br/> quite peculiar sort of magnetism about him in relation
             to<br/> those with whom he comes in contact. His ordinary<br/>
             appearance is masculine and cheerful: he never shows<br/>
             depression of spirits, and is sufficiently undemonstrative,<br/>
             and even somewhat silent in company. He has always<br/> been
             carried by predilection towards the society of the<br/> common
             people; but is not the less for that open to<br/> refined and
             artistic impressions&#8212;fond of operatic and<br/> other good
             music, and discerning in works of art. As to<br/>

             <br/> either praise or blame of what he writes, he is totally
             in-<br/> different, not to say scornful&#8212;having in fact a
             very<br/> decisive opinion of his own concerning its calibre
             and<br/> destinies. Thoreau, a very congenial spirit, said of<br/>
             Whitman "He is Democracy;" and again, "After all,<br/> he suggests
             something a little more than human." Lincoln<br/> broke out into
             the exclamation "Well, <i>he</i> looks like a<br/> man!" Whitman
             responded to the instinctive apprecia-<br/> tion of the President,
             considering him (it is said by Mr.<br/> Burroughs) "by far the
             noblest and purest of the political<br/> characters of the time;"
             and, if anything can cast, in the<br/> eyes of posterity, an added
             halo of brightness round the<br/> unsullied personal qualities and
             the great doings of Lincoln,<br/> it will assuredly be the written

              as only on sandy Long Island can the sun blaze. . . I<br/> saw

             swart<br/> sunburnt face and bare neck, he lay upon the
             brown-and-<br/> white grass&#8212;for the sun had burnt away its
             greenness&#8212;<br/> and was so like the earth upon which he
             rested that he<br/> seemed almost enough a part of it for one to

             name<br/> and reason for searching him out, and asked him if he
             did<br/> not find the sun rather hot. &rsquo;Not at all too
             hot,&rsquo; was his<br/> reply; and he confided to me that this
             was one of his<br/> favourite places and attitudes for composing
             &rsquo;poems.&rsquo; He<br/> then walked with me to his
             home, and took me along its<br/> narrow ways to his room. A small
             room of about fifteen<br/> feet square, with a single window
             looking out on the barren<br/> solitudes of the island; a small
             cot, a wash-stand with a<br/> little looking-glass hung over it
             from a tack in the wall, a<br/> pine table with pen, ink, and
             paper, on it; an old line-<br/> engraving representing Bacchus,
             hung on the wall, and<br/> opposite a similar one of Silenus; these
             constituted the<br/> visible environments of Walt Whitman. There
             was not,<br/> apparently, a single book in the room. . . The books
             he<br/> seemed to know and love best were the Bible, Homer,<br/>
             and Shakespeare: these he owned, and probably had in<br/> his
             pockets while we were talking. He had two studies<br/> where he
             read; one was the top of an omnibus, and the<br/> other a small
             mass of sand, then entirely uninhabited, far<br/> out in the ocean,
             called Coney Island. . . The only dis-<br/> tinguished contemporary

             bottom<br/> nothing but maudlin puerilities or more or less
             musical<br/> verbiage, arising out of a life of depression and
             enervation<br/> as their result; or else that class of poetry,
             plays, &amp;c., of<br/> which the foundation is feudalism, with
             its ideas of lords<br/> and ladies, its imported standard of
             gentility, and the<br/> manners of European high-life-below-stairs
             in every line<br/> and verse." Thus incited to poetic
             self-expression,<br/> Whitman (adds Mr. Conway) "wrote on a sheet
             of paper,<br/> in large letters, these words &rsquo;Make the
             Work,&rsquo; and fixed<br/> it above his table, where he could
             always see it whilst<br/> writing. Thenceforth every cloud that
             flitted over him,<br/> every distant sail, every face and form
             encountered, wrote<br/> a line in his book."<br/>

              has yet contributed." The edition of<br/> about a thousand copies

             poem<br/> beginning "A Woman waits for me." It excited a con-<br/>
             siderable storm. Another edition, of about four to five<br/>
             thousand copies, duodecimo, came out at Boston in<br/> 1860-61,
             including a number of new pieces. The <i>Drum<br/> Taps</i>,
             consequent upon the war, with their <i>Sequel</i> which<br/>
             comprises the poem on Lincoln, followed in 1865; and in<br/> 1867,
             as I have already noted, a complete edition of all<br/> the poems,
             including a supplement named <i>Songs before<br/> Parting</i>. The
             first of all the <i>Leaves of Grass</i>, in point<br/> of date, was
             the long and powerful composition, entitled,<br/>
             <i>Walt Whitman</i>&#8212;perhaps the most typical and
             memo-<br/> rable of all his productions, but shut out from the<br/>
             present selection for reasons given further on. The final<br/>
             edition shows numerous and considerable variations from<br/> all
             its precursors; evidencing once again that Whitman is<br/> by no
             means the rough-and-ready writer, panoplied in rude<br/> art and
             egotistic self-sufficiency, that many people suppose<br/> him to
             be. Even since this issue, the book has been<br/> slightly revised
             by its author&rsquo;s own hand, with a special<br/> view to
             possible English circulation. The copy so revised<br/> has reached

              reader con-<br/> tains a little less than half the entire bulk of
              Whitman&rsquo;s<br/> poetry. My choice has proceeded upon two
              simple rules:<br/> first, to omit entirely every poem which could
              with any<br/> tolerable fairness be deemed offensive to the
              feelings of<br/> morals or propriety in this peculiarly nervous
              age; and,<br/> second, to include every remaining poem which
              appeared<br/> to me of conspicuous beauty or interest. I have also
              in-<br/> serted the very remarkable prose preface which
              Whitman<br/> printed in the original edition of <i>Leaves of
              Grass</i>, an<br/> edition that has become a literary rarity. This
              preface<br/> has not been reproduced in any later publication,
              although<br/> its materials have to some extent been worked up
              into<br/> poems of a subsequent date.* From this prose
              composition,<br/> contrary to what has been my rule with any of
              the poems,<br/> it has appeared to me permissible to omit two or
              three<br/> short phrases which would have shocked ordinary
              readers,<br/> and the retention of which, had I held it

             <br/> be termed; to call them immoralities would be going too<br/>
             far. Whitman finds himself, and other men and women,<br/> to be a
             compound of soul and body; he finds that body<br/> plays an
             extremely prominent and determining part in<br/> whatever he and
             other mundane dwellers have cognizance<br/> of; he perceives this
             to be the necessary condition of<br/> things, and therefore, as he
             fully and openly accepts it,<br/> the right condition; and he knows
             of no reason why what<br/> is universally seen and known, necessary
             and right, should<br/> not also be allowed and proclaimed in
             speech. That such<br/> a view of the matter is entitled to a great
             deal of weight,<br/> and at any rate to candid consideration and
             construction,<br/> appears to me not to admit of a doubt; neither
             is it dubious<br/> that the contrary view, the only view which a
             mealy-<br/> mouthed British nineteenth century admits as
             endurable,<br/> amounts to the condemnation of nearly every great
             or<br/> eminent literary work of past time, whatever the
             century<br/> it belongs to, the country it comes from, the
             department<br/> of writing it illustrates, or the degree or sort of
             merit it<br/> possesses. Tenth, second, or first century before

             containing such impropriety,&#8212;can, if those notions<br/>

             moral or plainly descriptive as of avowedly playful, know-<br/>
             ing, or licentious books. For my part, I am far from<br/> thinking
             that earlier state of literature, and the public<br/> feeling from
             which it sprang, the wrong ones&#8212;and our<br/> present
             condition the only right one. Equally far there-<br/> fore am I
             from indignantly condemning Whitman for<br/> every startling
             allusion or expression which he has ad-<br/> mitted into his book,
             and which I, from motives of policy,<br/> have excluded from this
             selection; except, indeed, that I<br/> think many of his tabooed
             passages are extremely raw and<br/> ugly on the ground of poetic or
             literary art, whatever<br/> aspect they may bear in morals. I have
             been rigid in<br/> exclusion, because it appears to me highly
             desirable that<br/> a fair verdict on Whitman should now be
             pronounced in<br/> England on poetic grounds alone; and because it
             was<br/> clearly impossible that the book, with its audacities
             of<br/> topic and of expression included, should run the same<br/>
             chance of justice, and of circulation through refined minds<br/>
             and hands, which may possibly be accorded to it after the<br/>
             rejection of all such peccant poems. As already intimated,<br/> I
             have not in a single instance excised any <i>parts</i> of<br/>
             poems: to do so would have been, I conceive, no less<br/> wrongful
             towards the illustrious American than repug-<br/> nant, and indeed
             unendurable, to myself, who aspire to no<br/> Bowdlerian honours.
             The consequence is that the reader<br/> loses <i>in toto</i>
             several important poems, and some extremely<br/>

             quite<br/> exceptional value and excellence, entitled <i>Walt
              Whit-<br/> man</i>. I sacrifice them grudgingly; and yet

             with due<br/> regard to the one reasonable object which a selection
             can<br/> subserve&#8212;that of paving the way towards the issue
             and<br/> unprejudiced reception of a complete edition of the
             poems<br/> in England. For the benefit of misconstructionsists, let
             me<br/> add in distinct terms that, in respect of morals and
             pro-<br/> priety, I neither admire nor approve the
             incriminated<br/> passages in Whitman&rsquo;s poems, but on the
             contrary con-<br/> sider that most of them would be much better
             away; and,<br/> in respect of art, I doubt whether even one of them
             de-<br/> serves to be retained in the exact phraseology it at
             present<br/> exhibits. This, however, does not amount to saying
             that<br/> Whitman is a vile man, or a corrupt or corrupting
             writer:<br/> he is none of these.<br/>
             <div class="INDENTED">The only division of his poems into
              selections, made by<br/> Whitman himself, has been noted above:
               <i>Leaves of<br/> Grass, Songs before Parting,</i> supplementary
              to the pre-<br/> ceeding, and <i>Drum Taps,</i> with their
               <i>Sequel</i>. The peculiar<br/> title, <i>Leaves of Grass</i>,
              has become almost inseparable<br/> from the name of Whitman; it
              seems to express with<br/> some aptness the simplicity,
              universality, and spontaneity,<br/> of the poems to which it is
              applied. <i>Songs before<br/> Parting</i> may indicate that these
              compositions close<br/> Whitman&rsquo;s poetic roll. <i>Drum

             on<br/> the same theme: the chief person in this last section
             being<br/> the one on the death of Lincoln. These titles all apply
             to<br/> fully arranged series of compositions. The present
             volume<br/> is not in the same sense a fully arranged series, but
             a<br/> selection; and the relation of the poems <i>inter se</i>

             recognize<br/> in practice. I have therefore redistributed the
             poems (a<br/> latitude of action which I trust the author may not
             object<br/> to), bringing together those whose subject-matter seems
             to<br/> warrant it, however far separated they may possibly be
             in<br/> the original volume. At the same time, I have retained<br/>

             their<br/> future, or consigns them to the reader&rsquo;s
             consideration.<br/> It deserves mention that, in the copy of
             Whitman&rsquo;s last<br/> American edition revised by his own
             hand as previously<br/> noticed, the series termed <i>Songs of
              Parting</i> has been<br/> recast, and made to consist of poems of
             the same character<br/> as those included in my section No. 5.<br/>
             <div class="INDENTED">Comparatively few of Whitman&rsquo;s
              poems have been en-<br/> dowed by himself with titles so properly
              called. Most of<br/> them are merely headed with the opening words
              of the<br/> poems themselves&#8212;as "I was looking a long
              while;" "To<br/> get betimes in Boston Town;" "When lilacs last in
              the<br/> door-yard bloomed;" and so on. It seems to me that in
              a<br/> selection such a lengthy and circuitous method of
              identi-<br/> fying the poems is not desirable: I should wish them
              to<br/> be remembered by brief, repeatable, and significant
              titles.<br/> I have therefore supplied titles of my own to such
              pieces<br/> as bear none in the original edition: wherever a real

             <br/> of those others, and to constitute a part of their
             excellence,<br/> can be traced also in Whitman. Let the questions
             rather<br/> be&#8212;Is he powerful? Is he American? Is he new?
             Is<br/> he rousing? Does he feel and make me feel? I enter-<br/>
             tain no doubt as to the response which in due course of<br/> time
             will be returned to these questions and such as<br/> these, in
             America, in England, and elsewhere&#8212;or to the<br/> further
             question, "Is Whitman then indeed a true and a<br/> great poet?"
             Lincoln&rsquo;s verdict bespeaks the ultimate<br/> decision
             upon him, in his books as in his habit as he lives&#8212;<br/>

             <div class="INDENTED">Walt Whitman occupies at the present moment
              a<br/> unique position on the globe, and one which, even in<br/>

              mally small number of men. He is the one man who enter-<br/> tains

              is the actual and prospective founder of a new<br/> poetic
              literature, and a great one&#8212;a literature
              proportional<br/> to the material vastness and the unmeasured
              destinies of<br/> America: he believes that the Columbus of the

              than<br/> himself in the future a founder and upbuilder of

             <br/> Were the idea untrue, it would still be a glorious
             dream,<br/> which a man of genius might be content to live in
             and<br/> die for: but is it untrue? Is it not, on the
             contrary,<br/> true, if not absolutely, yet with a most genuine and
             sub-<br/> stantial approximation? I believe it <i>is</i> thus true.
             I<br/> believe that Whitman is one of the huge, as yet mainly<br/>
             unrecognised, forces of our time; privileged to evoke, in<br/> a
             country hitherto still asking for its poet, a fresh, athletic,<br/>
             and American poetry, and predestined to be traced up to<br/> by
             generation after generation of believing and ardent&#8212;<br/>
             let us hope not servile&#8212;disciples.<br/>
             <div class="INDENTED">"Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of
              the world."<br/> Shelley, who knew what he was talking about when
              poetry<br/> was the subject, has said it, and with a profundity
              of<br/> truth. Whitman seems in a peculiar degree marked out<br/>
              for "legislation" of the kind referred to. His voice will<br/> one
              day be potential or magisterial wherever the English<br/> language
              is spoken&#8212;that is to say, in the four corners of<br/> the
              earth; and, in his own American hemisphere, the<br/> uttermost
              avatars of democracy will confess him not more<br/> their
              announcer than their inspirer.<br/>

             sleep-walking of the middle ages! The pride of<br/> the United
             States leaves the wealth and finesse of the<br/> cities, and all
             returns of commerce and agriculture, and<br/> all the magnitude of

              nents arrive as contributions: he gives them reception<br/> for
              their sake and his own sake. His spirit responds to<br/> his
              country&rsquo;s spirit: he incarnates its geography and<br/>
              natural life and rivers and lakes. Mississippi with<br/> annual

             that finish the verse. Not so the great psalm of<br/> the republic.
             Here the theme is creative, and has<br/> vista. Here comes one
             among the well-beloved stone-<br/> cutters, and plans with decision
             and science, and sees<br/> the solid and beautiful forms of the
             future where there<br/> are now no solid forms.<br/>
             <div class="INDENTED">Of all nations, the United States, with veins
              full of<br/> poetical stuff, most need poets, and will doubtless
              have the<br/> greatest, and use them the greatest. Their
              Presidents<br/> shall not be their common referee so much as their
              poets<br/> shall. Of all mankind, the great poet is the equable
              man.<br/> Not in him, but off from him, things are grotesque
              or<br/> eccentric, or fail of their sanity. Nothing out of its
              place<br/> is good, and nothing in its place is bad. He bestows
              on<br/> every object or quality its fit proportions, neither
              more<br/> nor less. He is the arbiter of the diverse, and he
              is<br/> the key. He is the equalizer of his age and land: he<br/>
              supplies what wants supplying, and checks what wants<br/>
              checking. If peace is the routine, out of him speaks the<br/>
              spirit of peace, large, rich, thrifty, building vast and<br/>

             not<br/> too far off. In war, he is the most deadly force of
             the<br/> war. Who recruits him recruits horse and foot: he<br/>
             fetches parks of artillery, the best that engineer ever<br/> knew.
             If the time becomes slothful and heavy, he knows<br/> how to arouse
             it: he can make every word he speaks<br/> draw blood. Whatever
             stagnates in the flat of custom or<br/> obedience or legislation,
             he never stagnates. Obedience<br/> does not master him, he masters
             it. High up out of<br/> reach, he stands turning a concentrated
             light; he turns<br/> the pivot with his finger; he baffles the
             swiftest runners<br/> as he stands, and easily overtakes and
             envelops them.<br/> The time straying toward infidelity and
             confections<br/> and persiflage he withholds by his steady faith;
             he<br/> spreads out his dishes; he offers the sweet
             firm-fibred<br/> meat that grows men and women. His brain is
             the<br/> ultimate brain. He is no arguer, he is judgment. He<br/>
             judges not as the judge judges, but as the sun falling<br/> around
             a helpless thing. As he sees the farthest, he has<br/> the most
             faith. His thoughts are the hymns of the praise<br/> of things. In
             the talk on the soul and eternity and God,<br/> off of his equal
             plane, he is silent. He sees eternity<br/> less like a play with a
             prologue and denouement: he<br/> sees eternity in men and
             women,&#8212;he does not see men<br/> and women as dreams or
             dots. Faith is the antiseptic of<br/> the soul,&#8212;it
             pervades the common people and preserves<br/> them: they never give

             unconsciousness about an illiterate person that humbles<br/> and
             mocks the power of the noblest expressive genius.<br/> The poet
             sees for a certainty how one not a great artist<br/> may be just as
             sacred and perfect as the greatest artist.<br/> The power to
             destroy or remould is freely used by<br/> him, but never the power
             of attack. What is past is past.<br/> If he does not expose
             superior models, and prove himself<br/> by every step he takes, he
             is not what is wanted. The<br/> presence of the greatest poet
             conquers; not parleying<br/> or struggling or any prepared
             attempts. Now he has<br/> passed that way, see! after him! there is
             not left any<br/> vestige of despair or misanthropy or cunning or
             exclu-<br/> siveness, or the ignominy of a nativity or colour,
             or<br/> delusion of hell or the necessity of hell; and no man<br/>

             <br/> this is removed from any proof but its own, and foreruns<br/>
             the identities of the spiritual world. A single glance of it<br/>
             mocks all the investigations of man, and all the instruments<br/>
             and books of the earth, and all reasoning. What is mar-<br/>

              which<br/> always attach to dumb real objects,&#8212;they
              expect him<br/> to indicate the path between reality and their

              the poetic, in<br/> outdoor people. They can never be assisted by
              poets<br/> to perceive: some may, but they never can. The

             <br/> and is in the soul. The profit of rhyme is that it drops<br/>
             seeds of a sweeter and more luxuriant rhyme; and, of<br/>
             uniformity, that it conveys itself into its own roots in the<br/>
             ground out of sight. The rhyme and uniformity of perfect<br/> poems
             show the free growth of metrical laws, and bud<br/> from them as
             unerringly and loosely as lilacs or roses on a<br/> bush, and take
             shapes as compact as the shapes of chest-<br/> nuts and oranges and
             melons and pears, and shed the<br/> perfume impalpable to form. The
             fluency and ornaments<br/> of the finest poems or music or orations
             or recitations<br/> are not independent, but dependent. All beauty
             comes<br/> from beautiful blood and a beautiful brain. If the
             great-<br/> nesses are in conjunction in a man or woman, it is<br/>
             enough&#8212;the fact will prevail through the universe:<br/>
             but the gaggery and gilt of a million years will not pre-<br/>
             vail. Who troubles himself about his ornaments or<br/> fluency is
             lost. This is what you shall do: Love the earth<br/> and sun and
             the animals, despise riches, give alms to<br/> every one that asks,
             stand up for the stupid and crazy,<br/> devote your income and
             labour to others, hate tyrants,<br/> argue not concerning God, have
             patience and indulgence<br/> towards the people, take off your hat
             to nothing known<br/> or unknown or to any man or number of men,
             go<br/> freely with powerful uneducated persons and with the<br/>
             young and with the mothers of families, read these leaves<br/> in
             the open air every season of every year of your life,<br/>

             complaint and jealousy and envy are corpses buried and<br/> rotten
             in the earth&#8212;he saw them buried. The sea is not<br/> surer
             of the shore, or the shore of the sea, than he is of<br/> the

             <div class="INDENTED">The fruition of beauty is no chance of hit
              or<br/> miss&#8212;it is inevitable as life&#8212;it is
              exact and plumb<br/> as gravitation. From the eyesight proceeds

              hearing, and from the voice proceeds another voice,<br/> eternally
              curious of the harmony of things with man.<br/> To these respond
              perfections, not only in the committees<br/> that were supposed to
              stand for the rest, but in the<br/> rest themselves just the same.
              These understand the<br/> law of perfection in masses and
              floods&#8212;that its finish<br/> is to each for itself and
              onward from itself&#8212;that it is<br/> profuse and

             <div class="INDENTED">Without effort, and without exposing in the
              least<br/> how it is done, the greatest poet brings the spirit
              of<br/> any or all events and passions and scenes and
              persons,<br/> some more and some less, to bear on your
              individual<br/> character, as you hear or read. To do this well is
              to<br/> compete with the laws that pursue and follow time.<br/>
              What is the purpose must surely be there, and the<br/> clue of it
              must be there; and the faintest indication is<br/> the indication
              of the best, and then becomes the clearest<br/> indication. Past
              and present and future are not disjoined<br/> but joined. The
              greatest poet forms the consistence of<br/> what is to be from
              what has been and is. He drags<br/> the dead out of their coffins,
              and stands them again<br/> on their feet: he says to the past,
              Rise and walk<br/> before me that I may realize you. He learns
              the<br/> lesson&#8212;he places himself where the future
              becomes<br/> present. The greatest poet does not only dazzle
              his<br/> rays over character and scenes and
              passions,&#8212;he<br/> finally ascends and finishes all: he
              exhibits the pin-<br/> nacles that no man can tell what they are
              for or<br/> what is beyond&#8212;he glows a moment on the
              extremest<br/> verge. He is most wonderful in his last
              half-hidden<br/> smile or frown: by that flash of the moment
              of<br/> parting the one that sees it shall be encouraged or<br/>
              terrified afterward for many years. The greatest poet<br/> does
              not moralize or make applications of morals,&#8212;he<br/>
              knows the soul. The soul has that measureless pride<br/>

             its own. But it has sympathy as measureless as its<br/> pride, and
             the one balances the other, and neither can<br/> stretch too far
             while it stretches in company with the<br/> other. The inmost
             secrets of art sleep with the twain.<br/> The greatest poet has
             lain close betwixt both, and they<br/> are vital in his style and thoughts.<br/>
             <div class="INDENTED">The art of art, the glory of expression and
              the sunshine<br/> of the light of letters, is simplicity. Nothing
              is better<br/> than simplicity,&#8212;nothing can make up for
              excess or for<br/> the lack of definiteness. To carry on the heave
              of impulse,<br/> and pierce intellectual depths, and give all
              subjects their<br/> articulations, are powers neither common nor
              very un-<br/> common. But to speak in literature with the
              perfect<br/> rectitude and insousiance of the movements of
              animals,<br/> and the unimpeachableness of the sentiment of trees
              in<br/> the woods and grass by the roadside, is the flawless<br/>
              triumph of art. If you have looked on him who has<br/> achieved
              it, you have looked on one of the masters of<br/> the artists of
              all nations and times. You shall not con-<br/> template the flight
              of the grey-gull over the bay, or the<br/> mettlesome action of
              the blood horse, or the tall leaning<br/> of sunflowers on their

              heaven, or the appearance of the<br/> moon afterward, with any
              more satisfaction than you<br/> shall contemplate him. The
              greatest poet has less a<br/> marked style, and is more the
              channel of thoughts and<br/>

             sharp show of the tushes of power,<br/> or the bringing to bear
             soldiers and cannon or any penal<br/> statutes. Liberty relies upon
             itself, invites no one,<br/> promises nothing, sits in calmness and
             light, is positive<br/> and composed, and knows no discouragement.
             The<br/> battle rages with many a loud alarm and frequent<br/>
             advance and retreat&#8212;the enemy triumphs&#8212;the
             prison,<br/> the handcuffs, the iron necklace and anklet, the

             toward the<br/> ground when they pass each other . . . . and is

              <br/> ness and causality, with a perfect sense of the oneness
              of<br/> nature, and the propriety of the same spirit applied<br/>
              to human affairs&#8212;these are called up of the float of<br/>
              the brain of the world to be parts of the greatest poet<br/> from
              his birth. Caution seldom goes far enough. It<br/> has been
              thought that the prudent citizen was the<br/> citizen who applied
              himself to solid gains, and did well<br/> for himself and his
              family, and completed a lawful life<br/> without debt or crime.
              The greatest poet sees and<br/> admits these economies as he sees
              the economies of food<br/> and sleep, but has higher notions of
              prudence than to<br/> think he gives much when he gives a few
              slight attentions<br/> at the latch of the gate. The premises of
              the prudence<br/> of life are not the hospitality of it, or the
              ripeness and<br/> harvest of it. Beyond the independence of a
              little sum<br/> laid aside for burial-money, and of a few
              clapboards<br/> around and shingles overhead on a lot of American
              soil<br/> owned, and the easy dollars that supply the
              year&rsquo;s plain<br/> clothing and meals, the melancholy
              prudence of the<br/> abandonment of such a great being as a man is

              their<br/> scorching days and icy nights, and all their stifling

              <br/> in youth or middle age, and the issuing sickness and<br/>
              desperate revolt at the close of a life without elevation<br/> or
              na&iuml;vet&eacute;, and the ghastly chatter of a death
              without<br/> serenity or majesty,&#8212;is the great fraud upon
              modern<br/> civilization and forethought; blotching the surface
              and<br/> system which civilization undeniably drafts, and
              moisten-<br/> ing with tears the immense features it spreads and
              spreads<br/> with such velocity before the reached kisses of
              the<br/> soul. Still the right explanation remains to be made<br/>
              about prudence. The prudence of the mere wealth and<br/>
              respectability of the most esteemed life appears too faint<br/>
              for the eye to observe at all when little and large alike<br/>
              drop quietly aside at the thought of the prudence suitable<br/>
              for immortality. What is wisdom that fills the thinness<br/> of a
              year or seventy or eighty years, to wisdom spaced<br/> out by
              ages, and coming back at a certain time with strong<br/>
              reinforcements and rich presents and the clear faces of<br/>
              wedding-guests as far as you can look in every direction<br/>
              running gaily toward you? Only the soul is of<br/>
              itself&#8212;all else has reference to what ensues. All
              that<br/> a person does or thinks is of consequence. Not a
              move<br/> can a man or woman make that affects him or her in<br/>
              a day or a month, or any part of the direct lifetime or<br/> the
              hour of death, but the same affects him or her<br/> onward
              afterward through the indirect lifetime. The<br/> indirect is
              always as great and real as the direct. The<br/> spirit receives
              from the body just as much as it gives<br/>

               a man as<br/> much as a woman. A great poem is no finish to a
               man<br/> or woman, but rather a beginning. Has any one
               fancied<br/> he could sit at last under some due authority, and

               takes<br/> he takes with firm sure grasp into live regions
               previously<br/> unattained. Thenceforward is no rest: they see

               the<br/> meanings. Now there shall be a man cohered out of<br/>
               tumult and chaos. The elder encourages the younger,<br/> and
               shows him how: they two shall launch off fear-<br/> lessly

                                        in which this word Calamus is to be

                                        is the very large and aromatic grass
